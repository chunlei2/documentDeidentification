HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Counts</PHI> has known metastatic breast cancer and has been on treatment with Fareston and Aredia .
On the day she was seen for her regular office evaluation and treatment , she was noted to be very slightly confused , nauseated , vomiting , and dehydrated .
Laboratory studies were obtained which showed that she was hypercalcemic and mildly azotemic .
Her calcium was 16.6 with an albumin of 2.5 and her creatinine was 2.6 .
She was admitted to the hospital and given intravenous Saline and then Lasix .
She was also treated with Calcitonin .
During this hospitalization with hydration and diuresis , her calcium fell to normal levels and her renal function corrected to normal .
It was felt that the cause of her hypercalcemia is related to progression of metastatic breast cancer and possibly as a flare to Fareston .
The Fareston was discontinued , Lupron 7.5 mg monthly was initiated and Arimidex 1 mg PO q.d. was initiated .
She was able to tolerate these medicines quite well .
In addition , we started her on Taxol 80 mg per meter square with the first dose administered on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/30</PHI>/2000 and to be continued as an outpatient .
She complained of some pain in her left lower extremity .
Deep venous thrombosis was shown by color flow Doppler and she was started on Fragmin and Coumadin during this hospitalization .
Fragmin will be continued as an outpatient until the Coumadin dose is established and then this can be discontinued .
The patient was discharged home with nursing care and will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fyfesaul</PHI> with her first appointment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI>/2000 .
We will continue her on treatment with Taxol .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73 year old female who was transferred for cardiac catheterization after ventricular fibrillation arrest in the setting of an acute inferior myocardial infarction and a urinary tract infection .
The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-16</PHI>-93 to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Diy Hospital</PHI> for an E. coli urinary tract infection .
The patient was readmitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-20</PHI>-93 because of fever , chills and a sudden onset of ventricular fibrillation arrest , successfully cardioverted back to rapid atrial fibrillation and finally to sinus rhythm , where an electrocardiogram then showed ST elevation in inferior leads .
Peak CPK was 2494 with 18% MB &apos;s .
She required intubation for mild to moderate congestive heart failure , treated with diuretics , intravenous nitroglycerin and heparin .
She had post-infarction angina , was transferred here for angiography and possible percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , blood pressure is 130/80 , pulse 74 and regular , respirations 14 .
Her chest demonstrated bibasilar crackles .
Cardiovascular exam :
the jugular venous pressure was seven centimeters , carotid upstroke normal .
The heart exam revealed a normal Sl and S2 was normally split .
There was an S4 , no S3 , grade II/VI apical murmur in systole , no rubs .
The abdomen was benign , unremarkable .
Extremities :
no calf tenderness or peripheral edema .
Peripheral pulses were 2+ and symmetrical bilaterally .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3-27</PHI>-93 , patient underwent cardiac catheterization , coronary and left ventricular angiography without complications .
Review of these angiograms demonstrated a dominant right coronary artery with a focal 50% stenosis in the mid-portion .
The left main coronary artery was clear .
The left anterior descending had moderate plaques with a 50% proximal stenosis of the right anterior oblique caudal view .
The proximal diagonal D1 had a 50% stenosis .
The circumflex had a long 30% stenosis proximally and an 80% stenosis at the origin of the second major marginal artery .
The left ventricular angiogram showed akinesis of the posterobasal walls , severe hypokinesis of the diaphragmatic wall and trace mitral regurgitation .
The patient was maintained on heparin anticoagulation .
An exercise tolerance test with Thallium was to be performed in order to assess myocardial viability in the infarct zone .
The right coronary artery lesion was complex and there was severe stenosis in the obtuse marginal 1 .
The patient had no further angina .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-2</PHI>-93 , she underwent a Persantine Thallium study .
This showed no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes for ischemia and no angina pectoris .
The thallium images showed a large region of persistently reduced blood flow involving the apex and inferoposterior segments of the left ventricular wall .
This was consistent with scar .
There was no definite perfusion abnormality in the circumflex zone .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/06</PHI>/94
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
1. Gait ataxia .
2. Communicating hydrocephalus .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES :
Lumbar puncture <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/5</PHI>/94 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Cimetidine 400 mg po b.i.d. ; aspirin 80 mg po q.d. ; Ventolin two puffs q.i.d. ;
WORK DISABILITY AND PROBABLE DURATION :
Permanent .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 75-year-old right handed man with a past history of migraine , peripheral neuropathy , gait ataxia , and microvascular leukomalacia on magnetic resonance imaging study , was admitted because of an abrupt worsening of walking .
He had a history of progressive gait ataxia since 1989 , worsening over the past few months , and a recent decline in memory and concentration .
Migraine headaches with visual changes , headache and photophobia had been present for many years .
A peripheral neuropathy was first diagnosed in 1989 , cause undetermined .
Increased imbalance occurred in 1991 , at which time he was unable to walk tandem and swayed on the Romberg test .
Thoracic and cervical spine magnetic resonance imaging study were normal .
Brain magnetic resonance imaging study showed atrophy and microvascular leukomalacia .
He had an episode of headache , flashing light , confusion and possible loss of consciousness in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 1993 , at which time an magnetic resonance imaging study of the brain was unchanged and MRA was negative .
Memory , gait and occasional urinary incontinence worsened after that time .
The present admission was prompted by an episode of inability to walk at all for the past two or three days .
A computerized tomography scan done in the emergency room showed enlarged ventricles , suggestive of communicating hydrocephalus .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pulse 72 and regular .
Blood pressure 154/90 .
He was alert and fully oriented , but had some trouble remembering current events and made one error in the Tom and Bill story after ten minutes .
There was no aphasia .
He was unable to get up from the bed without help .
Gait was quite ataxic , with short steps , requiring support , but no freezing in place .
He swayed backward on the Romberg test .
Upward gaze was decreased .
Cranial nerves otherwise normal .
Slight left iliopsoas weakness .
Tendon reflex is absent .
Plantars withal , possibly bilaterally extensor .
No Hoffmann reflexes .
No frontal lobe release signs .
Coordination normal .
Mild decreased vibration and position sense in the toes .
Pin prick sensation decreased below the ankles .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Routine laboratory studies were negative .
The computerized tomography scan showed the findings described above .
A therapeutic lumbar puncture was planned on the day after emergency admission , but his gait was noted to be considerably improved at that time , and the lumbar puncture was postponed until <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 5</PHI> , at which time 40 cc were removed .
The cerebrospinal fluid was benign .
There was slight further improvement of gait , mainly less unsteadiness , but no change in speed .
The gait was essentially what it had been before the episode of worsening prior to admission , moderate ataxia , slight flexed posture , very slight shuffling .
It was felt that this response and the presentation raised a definite question of symptomatic normal pressure hydrocephalus , but that this could not be diagnosed definitely at this time .
It was decided to continue to follow Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeshuff</PHI> on an outpatient basis , with a follow up appointment in one month .
If there is significant deterioration of gait , shunt treatment will be reconsidered .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1. Carotid stenosis .
2. Aortic stenosis .
3. Coronary artery disease .
PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76-year-old female who was admitted to the medicine service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04-29</PHI>-92 with a past history significant for aortic stenosis and chest pain who presented for evaluation for aortic valve replace-ment .
The patient has a history of exertional angina and chest pain associated with light-headedness for nine years which was noted to increase in frequency over the past year , then upon admission had light-headedness and chest pain with a dull pressure in her neck to her substernal area , with only minimal exertion such as &quot; walking across the room &quot; .
She states this light-headedness is often associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis occasionally with nausea .
She denies any vomiting , states that the episodes usually last about five minutes and are relieved with rest .
The pain and light-headedness is now severely lifestyle limiting and the patient requested evaluation for possible aortic valve replacement .
Cardiac risk factors hypercholesterolemia , hypertension , no history of tobacco use , diabetes or family history .
Past medical history is as stated above , aortic stenosis , found to be critical on echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-13</PHI>-92 , done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Otte A , New Jersey</PHI> and was found to have left ventricular hypertrophy and ejection fraction of 58% , no right heart wall motion abnormali-ties and an aortic valve gradient of greater than 100 .
She also has a history of uterine fibroids , status post total abdominal hysterectomy .
She has known bilateral carotid disease , stated to be greater than 70% bilaterally .
She has a history of glaucoma and a questionable history of claudication in her legs as well as a history of hypertension .
Medications on admission were only aspirin p.r.n. and Timoptic solution 0.5% to the left eye twice a day .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was afebrile with a blood pressure of 170/100 , heart rate of 70 .
HEENT examination notable for bilateral arcussenilis but otherwise unremarkable .
Her neck showed no JVD , there was a slow carotid upstroke bilaterally , there were bilateral carotid bruits versus transmitted murmur .
Chest was clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Cardiac examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with a normal S1 and S2 , 3/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border , no gallop was detected .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender with good bowel sounds .
Extremi-ties :
There is no clubbing , cyanosis or edema and her peripheral pulses were trace palpable .
LAB / X-RAY DATA :
Labs on admission :
Sodium 141 , potassium 5.0 , BUN 18 , creatinine 1.0 , PT 12.3 , PTT 24 , WBC 7.6 , hematocrit 41 , platelets 278,000 .
EKG revealed a normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 69 , left ventricular hyper-trophy with poor anterior progression of R-waves .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
She was admitted and evaluated by the cardiac surgery service after having undergone cardiac catheterization which revealed a 70% stenosis of her left circumflex artery , 50% stenosis of the left anterior descending and 10% stenosis of the right coronary artery .
Carotid angiography revealed left internal carotid stenosis of 90% , right internal carotid artery &quot; critical stenosis &quot; .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-01</PHI>-92 she was taken to the operating room at which time she underwent an aortic valve replacement with a # 19 St. Jude valve , coronary artery bypass graft times one with saphenous vein graft from the posterior descending artery to the obtuse marginal and right carotid endarterectomy .
This was performed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Medicine</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Room</PHI> .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was found postoperatively to have some left upper extremity weakness on proximal greater than distal musculature .
She was extubated on postoperative day number one and otherwise had an unremarkable postoperative course with the exception of her left upper extremity weakness .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-04</PHI>-92 she was evaluated by the neurology service , who recommended a CT scan , however no evidence of infarction was detected .
There was only diffuse small vessel disease noted .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-05</PHI>-92 she was noted to convert to atrial fibrillation which resolved spontaneously a few days later .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-07</PHI>-92 there was a a question of a new event with addition to the left upper extremity weakness , some noted right upper and right lower extremity discoordination .
She was begun on a heparin drip .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-9</PHI>-92 the right-sided symptoms worsened and she also had some elements of aphasia .
She underwent angiography on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-9</PHI>-92 which showed the right internal carotid artery to be patent , however there was highly significant stenosis of the left carotid artery and she was taken to the operating room later that day for a left carotid endarterectomy .
She was taken postoperatively the ICU where she was extubated on postoperative day number one and by <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-11</PHI>-92 she was noted to have markedly increased use of her right side , resolving aphasia and she was transferred to the floor with the residual deficit only noted to be some left upper extremity weakness .
She was worked up aggressively with the physical therapy and occupational services , made good progress and began ambulating with assistance with a walker but with minimal assistance from an aid .
She was feeding herself and was very enthusiastic and energetic in her participation in her rehabilitation activities .
She was maintained on heparin therapy initially but this was quickly switched over to Coumadin anticoagulation therapy which she will need to be on long-term for her aortic valve replacement .
DISPOSITION :
She is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rockdempbanri Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05-28</PHI>-92 to continue her rehabilitation .
Discharge medications :
Lopressor 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nifedipine 10 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Timoptic solution 0.5% OS b.i.d. ; Coumadin 1 mg alternating with 1.5 mg q.o.d. at q.h.s. and Haldol 2 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. in the evening , only for agitation associated with confusion .
Upon discharge it was the recommendation of the cardiology team that the patient &apos;s prothrombin time be monitored weekly and be kept at a ratio of 3-4 IU .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has had increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pain .
A cardiac catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 showed diffuse mid left anterior descending of 90% , 30% D1 and 70% circumflex .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room and tolerated the procedure well .
His intensive care unit stay was notable for intensive care unit psychosis which was treated with Haldol and Ativan .
He slowly resolved and became alert and oriented times three .
He was ambulating well .
He had a psychiatry consult who agreed with the management .
His blood pressure control was somewhat difficult in the intensive care unit .
He received beta blockers both po and IV .
This caused him to become bradycardic down to the rate of 40 &apos;s .
It was felt that he was not a beta blocker candidate postoperatively .
Therefore , his pressure control will be done with hydralazine and could later be controlled with another agent as his cardiologist sees fit .

The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dagreat Health</PHI> Service where she ruled out for a myocardial infarction by CK &apos;s and LDH &apos;s .
However , her EKG &apos;s did progress to T-wave inversions in V1-V6 , and it was felt that the patient most likely had at some point had a myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram was done which showed apical septal akinesis , but with well preserved systolic function .
The patient was started on Ecotrin and a beta blocker as well as Isordil and Diltiazem for the possibility of 5-FU induced vasal spasm .
Her medicines could not be increased beyond low doses secondary to a low systolic blood pressure .
Just prior to discharge , she underwent an exercise tolerance test with a modified Bruce protocol where she went seven minutes and seventeen seconds , and stopped secondary to fatigue .
She did not have any chest pain or EKG changes , however , hermaximal heart rate was 71 , and her blood pressure was 110/60 .
It was felt by the cardiologist on the case that this was more exercise than she usually did at home , and she was comfortable with the current medical regimen .
PROBLEM # 2 :
PANCREATIC CANCER .
The patient will be continued on her 5-FU as an outpatient , to be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Lumbosacral spines done during the admission did not show any change from x-rays done previously .
PROBLEM # 3 :
HISTORY OF DIZZINESS .
The patient complained of some dizziness and had a presyncopal episode prior to admission , however , the patient felt that her dizziness was unchanged from the dizziness that she had for several years .
She will be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
PROBLEM # 4 :
ANEMIA .
The patient had an anemia on admission .
She had normal iron and TIBC .
Reticulocyte count is pending at the time of this dictation .
I suspect that this is anemia of chronic disease , but could not rule out gastrointestinal blood loss , although she remained guaiac negative .
PROBLEM # 5 :
PYURIA .
The patient 8-10 white blood cells in the urine on admission , and the urine culture was no growth so far at the time of discharge .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is being discharged in stable condition , and is to be followed up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include Pepcid 20 mg b.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg b.i.d. , Diltiazem 30 mg t.i.d. , Isordil 10 mg t.i.d. , and Ecotrin one tablet p.o. q.d.
She should arrange to be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Liermfelsbelb</PHI> .
Her diet is a low cholesterol diet .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the ICU and was fully monitored with an A-line and Swan .
He was taken to cardiac cath where he was found to have a total occlusion of his LAD after his first diagonal .
His circumflex had a 60% obstruction prior to the obtuse marginal branch with a 60% stenosis of the obtuse marginal branch .
The obtuse marginal second branch was subtotally occluded .
The RCA had an 80% stenosis in its mid portion and 40% distal obstruction .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION .
CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE .
DIABETES ADULT ONSET .
HISTORY OF CARDIOVASUCLAR ACCIDENT .
GUAIAC POSITIVE .
IRON DEFICIENCY ANEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old man , who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tlowepeh Hospital</PHI> after an anterolateral MI , with post MI stuttering chest pain .
His coronary risks factors are prior MI , smoking until he quit more than forty years ago , and adult onset diabetes with question of increased cholesterol .
He has no history of hypertension or family history .
In 1960 , the patient had an MI complicated by ventricular ectopic arrhythmia .
At that time he was placed on Quinidine for his arrhythmia , questioned atrial fibrillation at that time .
Since then , he has had rare angina over the past year , and has been able to walk his dog one mile a day with occasional mild left-sided chest pain that is always relived by a brief rest .
He also notes an induration caudication in his left calf .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/15</PHI>/90 , he had a parietal headache at 8:00 a.m. that was followed promptly by left-sided chest pain without diaphoresis , shortness of breath , nausea , vomiting , or palpitations which lasted for an hour with awaxing and waning course .
He went to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tlowepeh Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room , where his blood pressure was 120/80 , heart rate was 94 , respiratory rate was 32 , and he had a blood gas which was pO2 73 , pH 7.44 , pCO2 32 , and a chest x-ray that showed mild congestive heart failure .
His EKG showed an intraventricular conduction delay with anterolateral ST depressions and T waves inversions .
Chest pains were relieved with oxygen by nasal prong , two liters .
He was tansferred to the Coronary Care Unit where he was treated with IV nitroglycerin and Diltiazem .
He was ruled in for a non-Q wave MI with peak CKs of 531 , positive for MB .
This course was complicated by a transient left bundle branch block on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17</PHI> , atrial fibrillation despite his Quinidine .
Quinidine level on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/16</PHI> was 1.4 .
He had a new apical systolic murmur noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/18</PHI> .
He had mild CHF , which was treated with Captopril and prn Lasix .
He had recurrent chest pains noted on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/17</PHI> three times , <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI> one time , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> .
The episode on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI> was noteworthy for shortness of breath and ST depression in V4-6 which required IV TNG , which was used briefly that night .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/22</PHI> , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Norri Hospital</PHI> for evaluation of his post MI angina .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
B12 IM , iron sulfate 324 mg t.i.d. , Diltiazem 60 q.i.d. , Diabeta 5 mg p.o.q.d. , Quinaglute 324 mg q. 12 hours , one baby aspirin b.i.d. , Halcion 0.25 mg p.o.q.h.s. , Nitrol Paste , Lasix 40 mg p.o.q.d. , Slow-K two tablets p.o.q.d. , Captopril 0.25 mg p.o.b.i.d. , Zantac 115 mg p.o.b.i.d , and Carafate 1 gram p.o.b.i.d.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease complicated by myocardial infarction and ventricular ectopic arrhythmia in 1960 , also a left-sided CVA in 1960 , adult onset diabetes , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation of unknown duration , anemia which was consistent with iron deficiency , a left retinal hemorrhage status post laser treatment last year .
Status post cholecystectomy , status post right inguinal herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature of 97 degrees with a rate of 90 in atrial fibrillation and blood pressure 110/82 .
The patient was pain free and resting comfortably .
His neck showed a left-sided carotid which was 2+ without bruit , and a right-sided carotid which was 1+ without bruit .
His jugulovenous distention was to 10 centimeters .
His one-year examination had bilateral basilar rales greater on the right than the left .
Heart examination showed a PMI , which was diffuse and inferiorly displaced with an auricular rhythm with an S1 and S2 , II/VI systolic ejection murmur , no rub or gallop was noted .
Rectal :
Guaiac positive .
Pulses :
2+ femoral without bruit , 1+ dorsalis pedis on the left , trace dorsalis pedis on the right and trace posterior tibial bilaterally .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Sodium 132 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 93 , bicarbonate 23 , BUN and creatinine of 29/1.4 , glucose 142 , hematocrit was 30.9 .
Hemoglobin was 10.7 white cell count was 8.2 , platelets 211 , PT and PTT were 13.4/37.6 , Quinidine was 2.5 , and CKA was 53 .
Pre-intubation ABG was pH of 7.39 , p02 81 , O2 saturation of 96% , C02 29 , total C02 18 .
After intubation his pH was 7.32 with a p02 208 , and 02 saturation 99.7% , pC02 28 , total C02 15 .
Repeat ABG done later had a pH of 7.38 p02 of 247 , O2 saturation of 99.9% , pC02 22 , total C02 of 14 .
Magnesium 2.1 initially and during the code was 1.8 , cholesterol 144 , triglyceride 121 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the unit and experienced some nausea and vomiting with minimal EKG changes .
He became tachycardic to the rate of 110 , with a blood pressure of 128 to 130 .
He was pain free with EKG ST depressions laterally .
Around 4:00 p.m. this occurred and he was given a beta blocker 2.5 mg IV push times four .
His heart rate went down to 60 .
At this time , he was also given 25 mg po of Lopressor .
Later , within an half hour the blood pressure dipped into the 70s systolic , and IV fluid was started .
He complained of continued nausea and vomiting .
He was given Compazine PR and was started on Dopamine and then Dobutamine was added when that did not appear sufficient to increase his blood pressure above 80 .
He had a good urinary output .
His systolic blood pressure was then in the 100 to 110 range and at that time his IV fluids were decreased .
However , acutely at around 8:00 p.m. the systolic blood pressure plummeted down to 60 to 70 and at this time a chest x-ray was done which showed moderate CHF .
The patient complained of pain between his shoulder blades and at this time IV fluid was increased , so was the Dopamine and Dobutamine .
On the above chest x-ray no evidence of dissection was noted .
Even with the increase in the pressors , heart rate dropped into the 50s .
Atropine X 2 amps were given and the heart rate was in the 60s with systolic blood pressure remaining in the 80 to 90 range by Doppler .
Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .
The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .
Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .
Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .
He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .
Atropine one amp was given .
At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .
There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .
At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .
At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .
The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.
The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .
The family was notified at the beginning of the code and about the time of placement of central access and spoken to again once the code was called .
Autopsy was requested , however , the patient &apos;s family will not give us their decision until tomorrow morning .

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI>/93
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
congestive heart failure .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
aortic stenosis ; coronary artery disease , status post multi vessel coronary artery bypass graft surgery , severe left ventricular dysfunction , chronic renal insufficiency .
ALLERGIES :
Sulfonamides .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
cardiac catheterization - <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 - two dimensional echocardiogram <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .
He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .
An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .
He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .
Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .
Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .
Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .
He returned for routine office evaluation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/25</PHI>/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .
The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .
The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .
There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .
The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .
There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .
The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .
His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .
The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , 1992 .
Later , an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .
The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .
The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .
There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .
The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .
There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .
A Persantine Thallium scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .
LABORATORY DATA :
potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .
This was of uncertain significance .
The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .
Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .
Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .
Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/93 .
At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .
There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .
Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .
There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .
The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .
The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .
A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .
A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .
The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .
The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .
The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .
The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .
The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .
Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .
These findings were reviewed with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Patella</PHI> and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> &apos;s management .
His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .
Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .
It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breun</PHI> aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .
He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .
He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .
We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wierst</PHI> and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .

Extremities - no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Pulses were 2+ throughout .
The rectal tone was normal with no enlarged prostate , and he was heme positive .
Neurologically , he opened his eyes with sternal rub , but not verbalization .
He did not have verbal communication and he did not follow verbal commands .
His pupils were asymmetric , 6 mm. to 4 mm. on the left , right pupil was 5 mm. reacting to 3 mm.
The discs were flat .
There was no retinopathy .
He responded to threat on the left , but not on the right .
He had a gag and good palpate movement .
The tongue was midline .
There was a right facial droop which was mild .
He had slight decreased corneal reflex on the right .
Motor - right flaccid arm and he moved his left purposefully , but did not squeeze his hands .
He lifted his left leg off the bed , but no against resistance .
His deep tendon reflexes were noted for symmetric reflexes with upper extremities being 2 and patella 3 .
He had clonus bilaterally with up going toe on the right , but not the left .
LABORATORY DATA :
An erythrocyte sedimentation rate 3 , hematocrit 44 , white blood count 21.7 , lytes within normal limits .
The head computerized tomography scan without contrast showed a 3 x 3 x 5 cm. hemorrhage extending form the left Sylvian fissure and put amen to the left front oparietal lobe .
There was mass effect and some midline shift .
There was blood in the bilateral posterior horns .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to then Neurologic Intensive Care Unit .
On admission , he was difficult to arouse and there was a large volume of heme aspirate per nasogastric tube .
His blood pressure was not elevated .
The aspirates soon became heme negative and he was started tube feds and replated for phosphate , magnesium , thiamine , folate and B12 .
Once stabilized , he was transferred to the floor .
An magnetic resonance imaging study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/17</PHI>/92 showed a 5.3 x 4 x 4 cm. hematoma involving the basilar ganglion .
The medial region of the hematoma was felt to be suspicious for tumor versus arteriovenous malformation .
There was no enhancement seen in the region of the original cerebellar medullo blastoma .
Given his weight loss , past history of medullo blastoma , the patient underwent metastatic work up which included a computerized tomography scan of the chest which initially suggested a left hilar mass .
This was followed up with a bronchoscopy and transbronchial biopsy was negative .
A repeat computerized tomography scan of the chest I minus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/27</PHI>/92 did not show the mass initially noted .
A cerebral angiogram of the left coronary artery was performed and unremarkable except for mass effect from the hematoma .
A testicular ultrasound was performed and was negative for mass .
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed and G-tube was performed at the same time .
There was no specific gastritis and inflammation noted in the bulb and duodenum .
An abdominal and pelvic computerized tomography scan was performed and revealed a 7 mm. hypodensity in the lateral left lobe of the liver which was non-enhancing .
The GI Service was consulted on this mass and suggested an magnetic resonance imaging study of the liver .
This confirmed an 8 mm. mass which was bright on T2 and homogeneous in the right lateral segment and medial lobe of the liver , which was consistent with a benign hemangioma or cyst .
The urine cytology was negative for malignant cells .
Initially , the patient remained drowsy until Decadron was added to his medical regimen .
He awoke significantly after that with increased alertness , ability to interact with his environment and follow commands .
He has slowly made progress with increased strength on the right side and ability to walk with assistance .
He was started on Dexedrine because there was a question of whether some component of his lethargy could be depression .
This seemed to help him remarkably with increased activity .
His Decadron has been tapered slowly to zero and his examination on discharge was as follows :
He still spends a lot of time in bed , although easily arousable .
He needs persistent persuasion to increase his activity and was oriented to person , place , but not date .
Speech was nonfluent with occasional single words .
He sleeps with a hypophonia , but occasionally will speak louder when he is in better spirits .
He followed all commands readily .
His pupils were equal and reactive from 4 to 2 mm .
There was some breakdown in saccads to smooth pursuit .
He had limited vertical up gaze .
He still had a significant right central facial droop .
His gag was intact with palatal movements .
On repetitive testing with Speech Therapy had not been able to swallow in a safe manner .
Thus , he continued to be nothing by mouth and on tube feeds .
He squints with his left eye when he tries to focus and claims this is because he sees double .
He had approximately 4+ to 5/5 strength in the right upper and lower extremities .
His left side was full .
He had marked dysmetria bilaterally , but left greater than right to finger to nose and his gait was very ataxic .
His deep tendon reflexes revealed slight hyper reflexia on the right with 3 right brachial radialis , triceps , biceps and patella .
HE had an upgoing toe .
On the left , his reflexes wee 2-2+ with a downgoing toe .
He had right clonus , which was sustained .
A head computerized tomography scan was repeated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/08</PHI>/92 which revealed some resolution of blood .
At that time , there was no evidence of a mass behind the hematoma .
It was felt with his weight loss , that this needs to be relooked at in one month .
Thus , he should return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> to have a repeat head computerized tomography scan in one month to further evaluate a possible mass lesion behind the hematoma .
Depending upon his head computerized tomography scan , he will proceed to a brain biopsy if needed .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This extremely complex 75 year old woman was admitted from an outside hospital with fever .
She was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/15</PHI>/93 when she began to experience intermittent confusion , diarrhea , and fevers up to 104 , associated with chills .
There were transient mental status changes but no convulsions or loss of consciousness .
She was also noted to have some diarrhea at this time .
Because of increasing mental status changes , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">O Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sondibrid Ey</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI> , and she was found to have a gram-positive urinary tract infection , high fever , and was started on Ciprofloxacin .
Blood cultures drawn on admission showed multiple organisms including Clostridium perfringens , coagulase negative Staph , and alpha hemolytic Streptococcus .
Her antibiotics were appropriately changed .
At the family &apos;s request , the patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Further evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Heaonboburg Linpack Grant Medical Center</PHI> , demonstrated that the patient had mitral valve endocarditis with mitral regurgitation that was initially managed medically .
Her antibiotics were appropriately adjusted because of the polymicrobial nature .
Cardiac echo showed that she had moderate mitral regurgitation , an enlarged left atrium , and good ventricular function .
There was a suggestion of mitral valve vegetation .
She was placed on intravenous antibiotics with gradual decrease in her temperature , although some low grade temperatures initially persisted .
The patient had an extensive evaluation over the days that followed in order to find potential sources .
She was evaluated by the Gynecology Service including the performance of a pelvic ultrasound and also by the GI Service where she underwent a barium enema .
There was no evidence of GI or pelvic disease which would account for the bacterial source .
In addition , she was evaluated by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sileyer Medical Center</PHI> and there was no evidence of active dental infection .
She had a cerebral magnetic resonance imaging study performed and there was evidence of stroke .
Because of her complex picture , and because the source of her sepsis was not found , the initial plan was to treat with antibiotics and hopefully obtain a completely sterile surgical field for subsequent valve replacement , if indicated .
Her temperature became low grade and it was initially stable with her mitral regurgitation .
Towards the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , she had become afebrile and the initial plan was to complete a full course of antibiotics to obtain a sterile surgical field .
A rash developed and antibiotics were appropriately changed and antibiotic levels were optimized .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/13</PHI> , she developed a sudden episode of pulmonary edema that resolved quickly and she was thought to have possible worsening of her mitral regurgitation .
She was moved to the Intensive Care Unit and underwent subsequent cardiac catheterization in preparation for possible surgery .
Her cardiac catheterization demonstrated minor coronary artery disease and severe mitral regurgitation with a suggestion of an annular abscess .
After considerable discussion among the physicians involved in the patient &apos;s care , it had become apparent that the mitral regurgitation had worsened .
Also , no source for sepsis had been found .
Because of worsening mitral regurgitation , and the findings of severe mitral regurgitation at cardiac catheterization , as well as elevated filling pressures , it was everyone &apos;s opinion that the patient would not wait to complete a long course of antibiotics .
Accordingly , she was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/93 .
During her cardiac procedure , she sustained dissection of the ascending aorta .
She , therefore , underwent graft replacement of her ascending aorta and mitral valve replacement .
Her valve was excised and any material that appeared infected was debrided .
It was possible to clean the area thoroughly and it also became apparent that there was evidence of calcification in and around the annulus consistent with prior rheumatic fever .
Her valve was replaced with a St. Jude Medical mitral prosthesis and it was possible to place the valve securely .
She weaned from cardiopulmonary bypass with hemodynamics consistent with extreme vasodilation , and she required enormous doses of vasoconstrictors to maintain her blood pressure .
She was bleeding after operation with her picture also consistent with coagulopathy , and the overall picture suggested the effects of systemic sepsis .
In the early postoperative period , she had evidence of tamponade , possibly related to compression from her lungs , as the patient was noted to have elevated inspiratory pressures on the ventilator .
The sternum was reopened with improvement in her hemodynamics and additional stability .
She was returned to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/22</PHI> and underwent mediastinal exploration , removal of some mediastinal clot , and by now , hemostasis had improved .
Her sternum was left opened and the skin wound was left opened , using an elastic membrane to close the chest .
With clotting factor replacement , bleeding gradually abated and was no longer a problem .
She subsequently developed ongoing manifestations of sepsis with sustained vasodilation and developed anuric renal failure which required peritoneal dialysis .
She remained on full support in the Intensive Care Unit , on dialysis , with ongoing evidence of acidosis .
Despite full support on multiple , high dose inotropic and vasoconstrictor agents , her clinical status continued to deteriorate and it became apparent that her prognosis was extremely poor .
After consultation with the family , it was decided to not resuscitate her and , with continued deterioration , she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/26</PHI>/93 at 11:10 a.m.
Autopsy permission was granted .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CML .
OTHER DIAGNOSES :
1. STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
2. INTRAPARENCHYMAL BLEED .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Larsen</PHI> was a 50-year-old salesman who in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26</PHI> was noted to have an elevated platelet count of 778,000 .
He was found to have CML .
He was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/07</PHI>/00 for a matched , unrelated donor bone marrow transplant .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
White blood cell count of 24.409 and platelets of 956,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient received his bone marrow transplant on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/12</PHI>/00 .
His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/24</PHI>/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .
A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/26</PHI>/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .
It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .
Although the patient &apos;s pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .
Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI>/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .
Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .
The patient gradually lost brain systolic ejection murmur function and was pronounced dead on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/00 .

Allergies :
no known drug allergies On initial physical examination on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 30th</PHI> the patient &apos;s blood pressure was 120/60 .
He was afebrile .
His heart was irregularly irregular with a III out of VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
His neurological examination was notable for fluent speech and intact mental status .
Cranial nerves which were normal .
On motor examination he had a slight right pronator drift with trace weakness in the right proximal upper extremity .
In the right leg he was initially 0 out of 5 in the iliopsoas and distally .
However several hours later in the morning he was 3 out of 5 of the iliopsoas , quads and hamstrings .
0 out of 5 more distally .

0 patella and ankle jerks bilateral .
Cerebellar exam :
He had normal finger to nose .
LABORATORY DATA :
unremarkable
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Neuro :
The patient was started on heparin for concern of embolic ACA stroke in the setting of atrial fibrillation or possibly artery to artery embolus given his left carotid stenosis .
The patient continued on hemodialysis .
He was seen by Interventional NeuroRadiology who recommended a CTA to better visualize question of left ICA stenosis .
CTA revealed patent ACA &apos;s with dominant left A1 segment , hypoplastic right A1 segment but good filling of anterior cerebrals bilaterally .
It did show stenosis of the left carotid proximal to the cavernous portion .
However it did show contrast throughout .
It was thought by NeuroRadiology that this lesion given its proximity to the petrous portion in bone would not be amenable to stenting .
Given the embolic appearance of the stroke the patient was changed from heparin to Plavix and aspirin for anticoagulation .
He was not placed on Coumadin given discussion with his primary care doctor and history of multiple GI bleeds on aspirin alone .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for acute and chronic shortness of breath .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was found to be in congestive heart failure and thought likely secondary to diastolic dysfunction secondary to hypertension .
The patient was also found to have pulmonary hypertension .
She ruled out for myocardial infarction with 3 negative enzymes .
On admission , she was diuresed with Lasix and was negative 1-2 liters per day for several days .
The diuresis was backed off when her bicarbonate increased from 36 to 39 .
She was restarted on 20 mg p.o. q day prior to discharge .
Her lipids were checked with a total cholesterol of 110 , triglycerides 59 , HDL32 , LDL 64 .
The patient had a D-dimer greater than 1000 with lower extremity non-invasive studies which were positive for a small right common femoral clot .
It was unclear whether this was old or new .
A TTE showed an ejection fraction of 60% , mild mitral regurgitation , left atrial enlargement , mild tricuspid regurgitation , pulmonary artery pressures of 44 plus right atrial pressure .
There was an intra-atrial shunt from the right to the left through a patent foramen ovale .
Chest CT was a poor study but did not show a pulmonary embolus .
The patient had subsequent dobutamine MIBI which was positive for inducible ischemia in the distribution of posterior descending coronary artery and posterolateral coronary artery with a small to medium perfusion defect in the inferolateral wall and basal inferior wall which was partially reversible .
The cardiology service saw the patient and recommended medical management only without catheterization .
Her blood pressure was high so Captopril was titrated up to 50 mg p.o. t.i.d. .
She will be discharged on Lisinopril with further titration as an outpatient .
She is on hydrochlorothiazide 50 mg p.o. q day .
Her atenolol was stopped due to bradycardia on admission but this may be restarted as an outpatient in gentle doses with careful monitoring of heart rate .
She is on an aspirin .
She will be discharged on Lasix 20 mg for continued control of her edema .
2. Pulmonary ;
Pulmonary hypertension as seen on echocardiogram .
Unclear whether there are chronic pulmonary embolus but did have positive test for deep venous thrombosis and will be treated with Coumadin .
An ABG was done which showed pH 7.34 , pCO2 78 , pO2 92 on 2 liters .
Her bicarbonate peaked at 39 and generally is in the 36-38 range .
She has severe sleep apnea and falls asleep midsentence .
She has episodes of not breathing .
BIPAP was attempted for 3 nights in a row and the patient did not tolerate this .
She will need pulmonary function studies as an outpatient as these were not done in the hospital .
The pulmonary team saw the patient and only recommended the above testing .
She needs home oxygen and is currently at 2 liters nasal cannula oxygen .
3. Infectious disease :
Evidence for cellulitis on her legs , likely due to distention from edema and poor perfusion .
She was originally started on cefazolin which was then changed to Keflex with good improvement .
She will need to continue for at least 10 more days or as clinically indicated by the course of her cellulitis .
4. Hematology :
D-dimer in the emergency room was greater than 1000 and a right common femoral clot was seen .
This clot was small and it was questionable as to whether it was old or new .
She was started on anticoagulation given the positive D-dimer .
Chest CT was nondiagnostic but did not show pulmonary embolus .
It was a poor study .
Heparin was maintained during her hospital course and then Lovenox was started .
Her dose was increased to 7.5 mg q day the day prior to discharge .
She will be discharged on this dose in addition to 1 day of Lovenox .
Discharge INR 1.8 .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
5. Fluids / electrolytes / nutrition :
Low salt diet .
Low cholesterol , low fat diet .
DISPOSITION ON DISCHARGE :
To rehabilitation .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS :
The patient needs physical therapy to increase stability in mobilization .
Need to try to control blood pressure .
Can increase her Ace inhibitor as tolerated .
May start beta-blocker at a low dose given mild bradycardia at atenolol 50 mg p.o. q day .
Need to continue oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula .
Needs anticoagulation for 6 months for right common femoral artery deep venous thrombosis .
Goal INR is 2.0-3.0 .
Should continue Keflex for 10 more days or as clinically indicated .
Need to follow INR after Keflex is discontinued as expect it will change .
The patient has severe sleep apnea and stops breathing during sleep .
This is her baseline status .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 79 year old female whose cardiac risk factors include hyperlipidemia , hypertension , type II diabetes mellitus , positive family history .
She had a minimally invasive single vessel coronary artery bypass graft in 1998 , consisting of a left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> , she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> with a myocardial infarction , complicated by cardiogenic shock .
She had cardiac catheretization at that time , which revealed patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , a dominant left circumflex artery , with an 80% stenosis and a patent right coronary artery .
She underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty and stent placement to the left circumflex artery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/30</PHI>/02 she presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> again , with acute onset of shortness of breath while at rest , without other associated symptoms .
She was diuresed and underwent cardiac catheterization , reported as a 90% right coronary artery stenosis , 100% native left anterior descending , patent left internal mammary artery to the left anterior descending , sclerotiic distal LAD , 80% mid left circumflex stenosis ; posterior descending artery of 40% and 80% sequentially .
Echocardiogram at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Abrat Hospital</PHI> showed left ventricular wall motion abnormalities with anteroapical aneurysm , EF of 20% , mild left atrial dilatation , aorticsclerosis and mild pulmonary hypertension .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty , plus / minus brachy therapy .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
This is a 79 year old female , with acute distress .
BLOOD PRESSURE 110/60 , heart rate 60 , irregular .
O2 hemostasis of 97% , neurological awake , alert and oriented x three but poor short term memory and mild confusion .
HEENT - PERRLA , EOMI .
Neck was soft and supple .
JVP flat .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with mildly diminished breath sounds at the bases .
S1 , S2 , without murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen soft , with positive bowel sounds .
No bruits audible .
Lower extremities without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
2+ bilateral femoral pulses without bruits .
LAB DATA RADIOLOGY :
Na 136 , K 4.5 , Cl 97 , CO2 26.7 .
BUN 29 , creat 1.7 .
Digoxin 1.0 , WBC 8.5 , hematocrit 34.5 , hemoglobin 11.2 , platelets 289 .
PT 13.7 / PTT 26.3 .
ECG revealed atrial fibrillation with a controlled ventricular response .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
This patent was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Memasound Honvanta Hospital</PHI> .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/8</PHI>/02 she underwent a Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the left circumflex in stent restenosis with a 3.0 x 10.0 cutting balloon and then underwent Percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the distal left circumflex lesion , followed by deployment of the 2.0 x 13.0 mm Pixel stent .
Following post deployment inflation , the vessel was at full volume without clot or dissection , and TIMI 3 flow .
She was maintained on Integrilin for 12 hours ; her sheaths were removed without difficulty .
After sheath removal , she was started on Fragmin in anticipation of maintaining anticoagulation for atrial fibrillation .
She felt right leg weakness during the procedure , but experienced a great deal of difficulty the following morning , ambulating to the bathroom due to this weakness , which resolved after 2-3 hours .
She was seen in consultation by Neurology .
She underwent head CT which showed old lacunes and bilateral basal ganglia and ? of small hypodensity in the left frontal lobe .
MRI was recommended , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/12</PHI> she underwent an MRI which revealed an acute infarct in the left posterior corona radiata and narrowing at the P2 segment of the right PCA .
After her right lower extremity weakness resolved , she was able to stand but was resistant to walking .
Throughout the hospitalization she remained fatigued and lethargic , resisting mobilization .
She had no further neurologic symptoms .
Post cath she developed contrast induced acute renal failure , with peak creat of 2.3 .
She was seen in consultation by the Renal service who followed along closely .
Eventually she had renal MRA which was reported as showing severe right renal artery stenosis .
In order to evaluate this , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/21</PHI> she underwent renal MRA which showed only moderate right renal artery stenosis that was non-obstructive .
Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .
She underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .
There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .
She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .
This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .
She was seen in consultation by PT , to evaluate both her deconditioning and her safety risk in terms of long term anticoagulation .
She was found to have a 4 x normal risk of falling , which was felt to be significant .
She however is at increased risk for further embolic phenomenon with atrial fibrillation .
She was maintained on Fragmin and will be considered for lowdose Coumadin once the Plavix is finished in a month if her gait and strength have improved .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
She is ready for discharge to a nursing facility for further strength training .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient is an 80 year old female with a history of dementia , and of a choreoathetotic movement disorder of unclear etiology .
She has had these problems for approximately 10 years , and is cared for by a family member .
W / U for Huntington &apos;s , ceruloplasmin , TSH , etc have all been negative in the past .
Now presents with report of sub-acute worsening of confusion .
Patient was admitted to neurology service .
She had a gradual imporvement of her confusion back towards baseline during the hospital stay .
The major therapeutic change during the hospitalization was the starting of zyprexa to see if as part of its side-effect profile it would decrease the choreoathetotic movement symptoms .
Infact , this medication was found to cause a significant improvement in her choreoathetotic perioral and arm movements .
She still has significant myoclonic component in her arms especially with volition , but this med will certainly be continued .
While essentially what we ARE hoping for in this use of the med is extra-pyramidal side effects , she should be monitored for any excessive or debilitating parkinsonian symptoms such as excessive rigidity .

There was no hepatosplenomegaly .
There was no erythema around the catheter site .
There was only mild suprapubic fullness that was not tender .
There was no guarding or rebound .
There was no peripheral edema .
On neurologic examination , the patient followed only simple commands .
She moved all extremities .
She had decreased strength bilaterally .
She missed her nose with both hands when asked to touch her nose .
There was a questionable positive Babinski on the right side .
The toes were downgoing on the left .
She answered appropriately to yes-no questions , but _____________
She appeared to understand questions , but then could not come up with the answers , or where she was , and she could not give her name , but did respond when her name was used .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a sodium of 146 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , CO2 31.6 , BUN 8 , creatinine 4.3 , glucose 94 , calcium 10.5 , magnesium 1.5 , phosphorus 2.5 .
Her liver function tests were all within normal limits .
Her coagulation factors showed a PT of 13.2 , INR 1.2 , PTT 23.2 .
Her white blood cell count was elevated at 17.6 .
The hematocrit was 43.3 , platelets 425,000 .
The differential was 85% polymorphonuclearleukocytes .
Abdominal CT scan from the outside hospital showed no abscess and left renal atrophy with multiple cysts .
The electroencephalogram showed left greater than right frontotemporal slowing throughout the tracing .
Head CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/30</PHI>/2002 showed prominent ventricles , cortical atrophy , and suggested infarct in the left thalamus , left insular cortex , and decreased attenuation in the right frontal lobe .
As noted , laboratory data at the outside hospital included a negative Clostridium difficile , a weakly positive D-dimer , a weakly positive lupus anticoagulant , and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 48 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient &apos;s presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer &apos;s of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .
Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .
In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .
An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .
In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .
In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .
For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .
For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO &apos;s and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO &apos;s with one to one supervision .
For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .
From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI>/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .
No obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .
Excellent suggestions from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pa</PHI> of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient &apos;s weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .
However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .
The patient &apos;s mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/12</PHI> and was markedly improved on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/13</PHI>/2002 , compared with the day of admission .
However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .
The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .
On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .
CA-125 levels were within normal limits .
We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .
We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .
Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Termarimed</PHI> pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .

SOCIAL HISTORY :
No tobacco , alcohol or drug use .
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">NVH</PHI> and started on vancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl .
Cultures were taken .
Blood cultures were done for a possible rectosigmoid mass or fistula and a CT showed questionable abscess versus tumor in the left lower quadrant .
Blood cultures done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/17</PHI>/03 grew C. perfringens .
Other blood culture was negative .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20</PHI>/03 , a PE protocol CT was negative for both DVT and PE .
The patient was taken to the operating room for bilateral stent placement , resection of the pelvic mass , lysis of adhesions , left ureterolysis , rectosigmoid resection , SBR , removal of a vaginal tumor , omentectomy complicated by an enterotomy and was admitted to the ICU postoperatively on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/21</PHI>/03 .
Postoperative course by systems is as follows :
1. Neuro :
She had a PCEA for pain , then a Dilaudid PCA .
The patient was anxious with depression poorly controlled until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/14</PHI>/03 .
The patient was seen by Onc Psychiatry consult , who recommended imipramine 75 mg ; that was subsequently increased to 150 mg p.o. q.h.s. , trazadone 100 mg q.h.s. and Ambien 10 mg q.h.s.

The patient has baseline hypertension that was difficult to control .
In the ICU , the patient was on enalapril , hydralazine and labetalol .
After a Cardiology consulton <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/13</PHI>/03 , the patient was started on metoprolol 100 mg p.o. q.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg q.d. , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d. .
Hydralazine was stopped .
Blood pressure stayed high with an SBP in the 170s , so amlodipine 10 mg q.d. was added and that blood pressure was still elevated .
At the time of transfer to the ________ Onc Service , blood pressure was within the normal range .
3. Pulmonary :
The patient was extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/22</PHI>/03 .
Once the patient was extubated , after the third surgery , the patient could not be weaned off 2 liters of nasal cannula and was to ______ to 20 breaths per minute despite nebulizer treatment .
The patient was restarted on Advair and by <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/15</PHI>/03 , was weaned to room air likely an effective Advair and control of anxiety and psychiatric issues .
4. GI :
On postoperative day 4 , after the initial surgery , the patient had increased shortness of breath and tachycardia with abdominal pain .
A chest x-ray revealed increased free air under the diaphragm .
A CT revealed a large amount of free air .
The patient was taken to the OR on postop day 5 for emergent exploratory laparotomy that disclosed a small bowel enterotomy with 2 liters of bilious fluid within the peritoneum .
On postop day 9 , the patient had a similar increased abdominal pain episode and was taken back to the operating room for another emergent exploratory laparotomy revealing another peroration at the site of previous repair .
Intraoperatively , the patient suffered hypotension with induction and respiratory insufficiency .
The patient was transferred to the ICU intubated with stable .
The patient was kept NPO with an NG tube until postop day 14 and_____ started on clear sips with TPN for nutritional supplementation .
The patient intermittently tolerated diet advancement , but then would vomit and would have the NG tube replaced .
The patient , at the time of transfer , was tolerating clears with low stoma output , likely to tolerate slow advancement .
The patient still had a PICC line at the time , although TPN was being held and calorie counts were done to evaluate the benefit of p.o. nutrition .
5. GU :
No issues .
The patient generally had good urine output .
Presumably , should follow up with the Urology Clinic for removal of the ureteral stents at some point .
6. Infectious Disease :
Blood cultures mentioned previously were positive for C. perfringens .
The patient was started on empiricvancomycin , levofloxacin and Flagyl after the second exploratory laparotomy .
She was started on vancomycin , levofloxacin , Flagyl , doxycycline and fluconazole .

JP drain was cultured on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11</PHI>/03 along with aurine culture .
TLC , TIB and blood culture were all negative .
These were cultured because the patient &apos;s white blood count was increasing to the mid 20s without fever or other symptoms for explanation .
The patient , at the time of transfer , to the Gyn / Onc Service was not antibiotics and the white blood cell count was trending down .
7. Heme :
The patient was stable .
She was receiving sub .q. heparin for DVT prophylaxis postoperatively .
On postop day 6 , an ID consult noted erythema at the right IJ line site .
On postop day 8 , the right IJ line was pulled .
The tip was cultured with no growth .
On postop day 9 , bilateral upper extremity Dopplers revealed a right IJ clot .
The patient was started on heparin .
The patient transitioned to Lovenox on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/09</PHI>/03 after a Cardiology consult indicated increased survival with Lovenox therapy .

REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Tennis</PHI> is a 65-year-old , white male , status post myocardial infarction x two , status post coronary artery bypass graft x three , with an ejection fraction of 20% on transplant workup , who presents with recurrent shortness of breath , chest pain , and light-headedness .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient has a history of myocardial infarction x two in 1984 and 1987 ( receiving tissue plasminogen activator in 1988 ) and subsequently was admitted to an outside hospital in 1992 with symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Utal Health</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 for unstable angina and symptoms of congestive heart failure .
He was hypotensive and intubated at that time and was subsequently stabilized .
Cardiac catheterization at that time revealed 50% to 70% left main , 50% to 70% proximal left anterior descending , 70% to 80% mid-left anterior descending , 100% proximal left circumflex , and proximal and distal 50% right coronary artery lesions .
An echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 25% .
He underwent a coronary artery bypass graft x three by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kennedy</PHI> with left internal mammary artery toleft anterior descending , saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery , saphenous vein graft to OM of the left circumflex .
The vein grafts were considered to be very close and of poor quality .
In the intervening period , he has had atrial fibrillation as his baseline rhythm which has been treated with Procainamide .
He has had numerous interval admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Shoreale Medical Health</PHI> for congestive heart failure of an increasing pattern in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/93 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 and then every three weeks since the beginning of the year .
He has had three-pillow orthopnea , paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea , and nocturia three to four times per night but no swelling and no weight gain ( although he has had four-inch increase in his abdominal girth in the past year ) .
His primary event complaints are episodes of shortness of breath with neck pain without radiation but with dizziness , light-headedness , pallor , and some chest pressure .
He often takes Nitroglycerin sublingual with relief of his chest pressure but no change in other symptoms .
He also complains of 30-yard dyspnea on exertion and one-block claudication .
He was recently seen in outpatient clinic by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Carbon</PHI> , where an echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction of 20% , mid-septalapical distal lateral wall akinesis , 2 to 3+ mitral regurgitation , and moderate left atrial enlargement .
His Procainamide was discontinued , and plans were made to start him on Amiodarone .
However , since the day prior to admission , he has had three episodes of shortness of breath with headache , diaphoresis , and pallor .
The night before admission , his blood pressure was 100/60 , and pulse was 76 .
He took Nitroglycerin x one with some relief of his shortness of breath but no change in his other symptoms .
The morning of admission , he had another episode with waves of nausea , dizziness , light-headedness , and pallor .
He came to the Emergency Room for evaluation .
In the Emergency Room , he was found to be in atrial fibrillation with a rate of 120 to 150 and with a blood pressure of 124/84 and 98% O2 saturation .
He was admitted for diuresis for management of his arrhythmia .

The INR was 2.5 , PTT 38.8 .
ELECTROCARDIOGRAM :
The electrocardiogram revealed atrial fibrillation at 128 per minute with no detectable P-R interval , QRS of 0.09 , and QTC of 0.42 .
His axis was +50 degrees with an incomplete bundle branch block .
ASSESSMENT AND PLAN :
In summary , he was found to have strong symptoms of congestive heart failure by history , which were consistent with a chronic picture and low ejection fraction .
He was planned for initial medical management with optimization of his cardioactive medications , loading on Amiodarone and diuresis .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was loaded on Amiodarone while under surveillance with cardiac monitor and was aggressively diuresed .
A right heart catheterization was performed , and a left heart catheterization was performed , which revealed a right atrial pressure of 10 , a right ventricular pressure of 60/10 , a pulmonary arterial pressure of 40 , a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 34 , a left ventricular pressure of 115/24 .
His left internal mammary artery to left anterior descending was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery was patent ; his saphenous vein graft to OM was not detected by the aortic root shot .
The ejection fraction was not calculated .
A Swan-Ganz catheter was placed , and his medications were tailored over the course of the following 48 hours by following the appropriate parameters .
The Swan-Ganz catheter was subsequently removed , and his medications were continued to be tuned empirically .
During this time , he continued to complain of occasional chest pain which was variably relieved by sublingual Nitroglycerin , intravenous Metoprolol , and Morphine .
There were no EKG changes during these episodes .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/22</PHI> , after an appropriate load of Amiodarone , he was successfully cardioverted into normal sinus rhythm , 100 , 200 , 360 , 360 .
There were no complications from this procedure , and he remained in normal sinus rhythm until the time of discharge .
He was reloaded back upon Coumadin and reached a therapeutic INR .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/28</PHI>/76 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Melvean Ace</PHI> .
She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. &apos;s .
She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .
She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.
Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .
In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Times</PHI> , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .
She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .
She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Pedines Community Hospital</PHI> found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .
A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .
Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> for further evaluation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .
The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .
This was on diltiazem and digoxin .
At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .
Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .
We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .
Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .
She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .
Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/4</PHI> , and diltiazem was restarted .
A cardiac catheterization was carried out on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI> , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .
It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .
The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .
The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .
There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .
The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .
Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .
With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .
A permanent pacemaker was put in on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/6</PHI>/92 .
This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .
She tolerated the procedure well .
On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .
On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .
We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .
We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .
If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Avejoh Wierst</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em Neighburce</PHI> .

Primary repair of atrioseptal defect , patent foramen ovale .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">List</PHI> is a 67 year-old diabetic woman with a known thoracic aortic dissection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 29</PHI> , 1996 , the patient developed abdominal and back pain and presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Drain Hospital</PHI> .
A dissected descending thoracic aorta was diagnosed by transesophageal echocardiogram .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">En&apos;s Healthcare</PHI> for work-up .
She was intubated with pulmonary edema and followed by serial examinations .
The patient refused surgery per report .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 2</PHI> CT scan of the chest showed a type III descending thoracic aortic aneurysm beginning distal to the left subclavian artery and ending above the renal artery .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 4</PHI> , a CT scan of the chest demonstrated bilateral pleural effusions , parenchymal consolidation right greater than left , aortic dissection with true and false lumens , well delineated flap with compression of the true lumen secondary to mass effect of thrombus in the false lumen .
There was a mediastinal hematoma .
There was a low density abnormality surrounding the ascending aorta .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 23</PHI> , 1996 , the patient had a CT scan , again showing ascending aorta with low density abnormality , with findings suspicious for involvement of the ascending aorta by dissection , bilateral pleural effusions were improved .
The patient reports having been hospitalized for approximately one month , at which time she was discharged to a nursing home after refusing surgery .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She is in no acute distress .
She is afebrile with irregular heart rate at 96 .
Blood pressure is 138/72 .
She is on room air at 90% .
Oropharynx showed poor dentition with apparent decay of the remaining teeth and gum recession .
Neck showed 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits , increased jugular venous distention .
The lungs demonstrated wheezes on auscultation with crackles at the bases .
Cardiovascular was irregularly irregular rhythm and rate .
Holosystolic murmur , II / VI , at the left lower sternal border .
The abdomen was obese , protuberant , nontender with well-healed surgical scars .
Extremities showed no clubbing or cyanosis .
There was pedal edema to the ankles bilaterally .
Varicosities particularly left lower extremity front and back and right upper extremity medially .
There were 2+ pedal pulses bilaterally , 2+ radial pulses bilaterally .
Neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Significant for white blood cell count of 6.8. BUN 14 , creatinine 1 .
Liver function tests were within normal limits .
Urinalysis was negative .
Electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation at 102 with an old anterior myocardial infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for preoperative work-up prior to planned repair of her ascending aortic dissection .
Given her history reported from outside source of a bleeding diathesis , Hematology consult was obtained who felt that she had no evidence of qualitative abnormality orcoagulopathy .
The patient was evaluated by the Dental Service , who felt that it was necessary to extract several teeth and to follow several more , specifically tooth 15 and 16 , that were fully impacted .
The patient received periprocedure antibiotics .
The patient underwent echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating 2/4+ tricuspid regurgitation with a peak velocity of 2.9 ; mitral regurgitation 2/4 , mild concentric hypertrophy of the left ventricle ; no systolic function with mild septal hypokinesis .
The ejection fraction was estimated at 55% .
The aortic valve appeared sclerotic with mild to moderate insufficiency .
The ascending aorta appeared severely dilated immediately after the root at 7.7 centimeters .
Dissection flap was noted .
There was pulmonary artery systolic pressure estimated at 34 mmHg plus right atrial pressure .
There was also evidence of a secundum type atrioseptal defect , approximately 0.5 centimeters in size , with elevated right atrial pressure .
The patient also underwent cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 25</PHI> , 1997 , demonstrating elevated right heart filling pressures with a mean right atrial pressure of 19 , right ventricular pressure of 56/19 , pulmonary artery pressure of 56/23/39 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 24/26/21 .
Evidence of atrioseptal defect again was noted with a calculation of 2:1 .
Non selective coronary arteriography performed did not reveal the presence of any focal coronary artery disease .
The aortic root angiography revealed the presence of an extensive ascending aortic dissection .
True lumen could not be accessed from either the left or right femoral artery .
The true lumen required access by right radial artery and tortuous innominate artery .
The patient was taken to the Operating Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jul 26</PHI> , 1997 , where she underwent resection and repair of chronic aortic dissection and reconstruction of the super coronary tube graft Hemashield # 28 as well as primary repair of an atrioseptal defect which appeared consistent with a patent foramen ovale and was 1-2 centimeters insize .
Postoperatively the patient did require epinephrine and Levophed as well as resuscitation , multiple blood products .
On postoperative day number one , however , the patient was hemodynamically stable on a small amount of heparin and nitroglycerin with a cardiac index of 3 .
The patient required diuresis in her course after receiving multiple blood products .
Beta blocker was started as well .
The patient was transferred to the floor after a slow ventilator wean .
The patient was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number three .
She did demonstrate evidence of a right brachial neuropathy , likely associated with the extensive dissection required for access to the right axillary artery , given the patient &apos;s distorted anatomy due to the large dissection .
The patient was evaluated by Physical Therapy and Occupational Therapy and received therapy to the right upper extremity and hand .
She will require continued therapy .
Otherwise the patient was neurologically intact .
She has worked well with Physical Therapy with regard to ambulation and has tolerated a regular diet without difficulty .
The patient was in persistent atrial fibrillation postoperatively .
The determination was made not to Coumadinize the patient given herchronic descending thoracic dissection and history of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient has been chronically in atrial fibrillation preoperatively without Coumadin therapy .
The patient did require extensive pulmonary toilet and she continues to benefit from nebulizer therapy , chest physiotherapy and diuresis .
Her chest x-ray prior to discharge demonstrated bilateral small effusions , right greater than left .
On 2 liters nasal cannulaoxygen , she is saturating at 93-95% .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be transferred to rehabilitation for reconditioning in general and specifically in regard to her right upper extremity .
She will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Spotted</PHI> in four to six weeks ; with her cardiologist in one week .

RADIOLOGIC STUDIES :
Chest x-ray <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 :
Elevated left hemidiaphragm of uncertain etiology or duration .
Postoperative changes of the sternum and media stinum were seen and no acute pulmonary disease was visualized .
The patient also had a shoulder film done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 that showed a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus with proximal distraction .
A lucency and irregularity of the glenoid , possibly representing a fracture , was also seen , and a CT scan was therefore obtained in order to evaluate this area .
This CT scan , done also on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/10</PHI>/97 , again showed the severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
Two major fracture fragments were seen at the humeral head , articulating with the glenoid fossa .
The fracture fragments retained their proper site of articulation with the glenoid fossa .
Innumerable smaller fracture fragments were interposed between the fracture fragment and the distal humeral shaft .
The glenoid fossa was intact .
No scapular fractures were present .
EKG :
normal sinus rhythm at 72 beats / minute , intraventricular conduction delay , Q - waves seen in II , III , and AVF with probable old inferior myocardial infarction .
T - waves were also noted to be inverted in I and AVL .
Ventricular bigeminy was also seen .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1. ORTHOPEDICS :
The patient has a severely comminuted fracture of the proximal left humerus .
He is status post a hemiarthroplasty on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 .
He received Ancef preoperatively .
Physical Therapy has been seeing the patient and putting him through passive external rotation to the neutral position of the left shoulder and forward flexion with physical therapy assistance .
Brittle bones were noted during the operation .
A bone density scan would be recommended as an outpatient , in order to evaluate this .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has right facial droop , right ptosis , stable and present for greater than one year .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
No chest pain , no shortness of breath , 1+ ankle edema .
The patient was ruled out for a myocardial infarction , given his fall at the airport and bigeminy seen on electrocardiogram that he developed during conscious sedation during reduction of the fracture .
Cardiology was consulted and aspirin and beta blocker added to his regimen , as well as chest wall nitroglycerin around the time of surgery , which was subsequently discontinued .
An adenosine SESTAMIBI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/12</PHI>/97 , which showed a negative electrocardiogram for ischemia and cardiac perfusion scans , with a moderate-sized , dense , fixed inferior defect indicative of scar .
A small / moderate-sized , mild-intensity , reversible posterior lateral defect was also seen , indicative of mild / moderate ischemia .
An echocardiogram was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Columbus Day</PHI> which showed an ejection fraction of 50% , left atrial enlargement , thickening of the aortic wall consistent with atherosclerotic changes , left ventricle size , and systolic function within normal limits .
Cardiac monitor was placed on the patient , given the bigeminy , and he did rule out for myocardial infarction .
Cardiology recommended that in addition to the medications already stated above , his hematocrit be kept greater than 30 .
After his procedure on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/17</PHI>/97 , elevated CPKs were noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/20</PHI>/97 , and the first level was 744 , CPK # 2 635 , and CPK # 3 461 .
MB fractionations of the CPKs were all negative and were thought to be secondary to the patient &apos;s beginning physical therapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 , and all muscular in origin .
4. GASTROENTEROLOGY :
GI was consulted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 for melena , decreased hematocrit prior to his humeral fixation surgery .
Upper endoscopy x 2 were done .
The first was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 , which showed clotted blood in the esophagus .
The stomach had evidence of prior surgery and old blood in the stomach .
It was thought that the blood in the esophagus was secondary to a possible Mallory-Weiss tear .
A second endoscopy was also performed several days later , in order to rule out a gastric ulcer , and also because the patient had had another episode of melena .
A gastric ulcer was found and this was biopsied and pathology is pending at this time .
This report needs to be followed up , and will be available at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> in the Pathology Department some time within the next three to seven days .
The patient also needs a repeat endoscopy and a GI follow-up appointment inapproximately two months .
I have spoken with the patient in detail , and he will be getting in touch with his primary-care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fordwoodall Stick</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ranegei Pkwy , Verertliet , South Carolina 62156</PHI> .
The patient is to arrange follow up with a GI doctor in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Jotar Boulevard , Cunahtampfordama , South Dakota 62848</PHI> through his primary-care physician .
The patient was initially on Cimetidine and Carafate here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> , and then switched to Prilosec 20 mg bid .
5. PULMONARY :
The patient &apos;s admitting chest x-ray showed an elevated left hemidiaphragm consistent with atelectasis versus splinting on that side .
Incentive spirometry was started .
Albuterol and Atrovent nebulizers were done .
The patient received chest physical therapy bid .
6. ENDOCRINE :
The patient needs still better diabetes control .
He has been somewhat noncompliant with his diet ( eating Pringle &apos;s in the room ) .
His NPH was recently increased today ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 ) to 24 units in the a.m. and 14 units in the p.m. with CZI sliding-scale coverage .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/19</PHI>/97 showed moderate occult blood , pH 5 , albumin 1+ , white blood cells present , 2-50 red blood cell , 10-20 white blood cells , few bacteria , and moderate bladder epithelial cells .
Floxin 200 mg po bid was begun .
However , his urine culture from the same day remained negative , and this was discontinued two days later .
A repeat urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/22</PHI>/97 was negative .
8. RENAL :
After the patient &apos;s procedure , he was felt to be volume overloaded .
He was given Lasix 40 mg IV x 1 and also had Nitro paste around the time of his surgery and beta blocker .
The patient became slightly hypotensive on the night of <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 with systolic blood pressures in the 80s to 90s.
His BUN/ creatinine rose from 16/1.2 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 25/1.9 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/18</PHI>/97 to 22/9.1 to today &apos;s labs , which are 15/0.7 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/23</PHI>/97 .
9. HEMATOLOGY :
The patient transfused 2 units on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/15</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 27.6 .
The patient transfused 2 units of <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/16</PHI>/97 for a hematocrit of 30.03 .

METASTATIC ADENOCARCINOMA OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
INTRAUTERINE PREGNANCY AT 23 WEEKS .
HYPERCALCEMIA .
INFERIOR VENA CAVA OBSTRUCTION .
IMPENDING SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION .
IDENTIFICATION DATA :
The patient is a 34-year-old female with a 22 week intrauterine pregnancy who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> with diffuse metastatic adenocarcinoma of unknown primary .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was in her usual state of excellent health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of 1991 when she first noted a left clavicular mass .
Subsequently , the mass continued to increase in size .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/23</PHI> , she was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Stonge</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> where a 3 x 7 cm left mid clavicular mass was noted .
A fine needle aspirate of this mass reportedly revealed giant cell tumor .
The patient was initially told that this was a benign tumor and that it could simply be watched and definitively treated after the delivery of her baby .
Subsequently , the mass progressively increased in size and the patient had developed significant discomfort in this region .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI> , the patient underwent a local tumor debulking at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> under local anesthesia .
The pathology , unfortunately , revealed an aggressive adenocarcinoma ( micropapillary type ; mucin producing ) .
This prompted further staging work-up .
The patient subsequently had a limited chest CT at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bri Health</PHI> which showed diffuse bilateral pulmonary metastases , metastases to the sternum , rib , multiple spinal levels ; internal mammary lymphadenopathy .
The poor prognosis for the patient and child were discussed and after the patient decided to have an elective abortion , an abdominal CT scan was obtained which revealed diffuse metastatic lesions of the liverspine , ribs and most of the lymph nodes .
There was no obvious GIor pancreatic tumor identified .
The patient had a very firm nodule at the vertex of her calvarium .
A specimen was obtained by fine needle aspiration and the pathology of this was consistent with adenocarcinoma .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nimaconwood Valley Hospital</PHI> for management of her cancer and termination of the pregnancy .
Over the past four weeks , the patient reported progressive shortness of breath and mid thoracic back pain .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient had an elective termination of her pregnancy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/13</PHI>/91 .
The work-up for the extent of the patient &apos;s disease included MRI scan of the cervical and thoracic spine which revealed multiple metastatic lesions in the vertebral bodies ; a T3 lesion extending from the body to the right neural for amina with foraminal obstruction .
An epidural mass was present at T10 which was extending from the lamina or spinous process anteriorly and almost compressing the spinal cord .
An abdominal and pelvic CT scan with IV contrast revealed bilateral pulmonary nodules and bilateral pleural effusions , extensive liver metastases , narrowing of the intra hepatic IVC and distention of the azygous system suggestive of IVC obstruction by liver metastases ; ascites ; multiple bony metastases ; and an isolated splenic metastases .
A bone scan revealed increased uptake in the left chest wall , left anterior ribs four to six , and increased uptake in the left and right lateral skull in the area of the parotids .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
1) ACQUIRED IMMUNODEFICIENCY SYNDROME .
2) PNEUMOCYSTIS CARINII PNEUMONIA .
3) ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Breutzfarstxei</PHI> was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/17</PHI>/91 .
He was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .
He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .
He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .
At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .
He was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> as an out-patient .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI>/91 , he was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> and at that point , his temperature was noted to be 101.4 and he had malaise and diarrhea .
He was evaluated in the Emergency Room .
At that time , his oxygen saturation was only 90% on room air and his chest X-Ray showed no change .
Cultures were taken and he was sent out .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/08</PHI>/91 , the patient called Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Seen</PHI> because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .
He was seen in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">FLFDMC</PHI> where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .
Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .
His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .
2) Recent PCP .
3) Status post right elbow surgery .
4) Venereal disease history .
5) PPD anergic .
The patient &apos;s HIV risk factors include history of intravenous drug abuse , prostitution , and a former prisoner .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On presentation , the patient was a young appearing Hispanic male in mild respiratory distress with a blood pressure of 140/90 , heart rate 120 , respirations 32 , and temperature 101 .
SKIN :
Jaundiced .
HEENT :
Revealed icteric sclerae , the oropharynx with extensive thrush , and an ulcer under his tongue .
NECK :
He had no cervical adenopathy and his neck was supple .
LUNGS :
Had tubular breath sounds especially in the lower lung fields .
CARDIAC :
Showed regular rate and rhythm without murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
There was no costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Soft with bowel sounds and there was mid epigastric and right upper quadrant tenderness .
His liver was 10 cm and was felt three finger breadths below the costal margin .
His spleen was not palpable .
RECTAL :
He had guaiac positive stools .
EXTREMITIES :
Unremarkable .
GENITOURINARY :
His penis had a 1/2 cm ulcer with yellowish discharge .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , white count was 7.2 with 57% neutrophils , 40% lymphocytes , l mononuclear cell , and 1.6 eosinophils .
PT was 12.6 and PTT was 29 .
Sodium was 133 , potassium was 4.2 , chloride 100 , CO2 19 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.2 , and glucose 122 .
ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .
( On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/06</PHI> , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .
His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .
His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .
In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .
He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .
The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .
He was given supplemental oxygen .
In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .
Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .
Stool was sent for ova and parasites .
Gastrointestinal was consulted .
Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .
However , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .
Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient &apos;s respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/10</PHI>/91 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/11</PHI>/91 .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .
Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .
However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .
The patient &apos;s abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .
The patient &apos;s liver function tests appeared to improve .
The patient &apos;s penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/13</PHI>/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .
No other cultures grew out and the patient &apos;s clinical status deteriorated .
The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .
He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .
Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .
However , the patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .
Patient underwent liver biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .
The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/15</PHI>/91 .
These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .
They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .
Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .
Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .
Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .
This was done on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/18</PHI>/91 .
Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.
DISPOSITION :
The patient died in hospital .
An autopsy will be performed .
An autopsy was performed as per the family &apos;s wishes .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotereef</PHI> is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">93-year-old</PHI> woman who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with renal insufficiency .
The patient was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/10</PHI>/98 when she was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daleglo Medical Center</PHI> with a chief complaint of falling and mental status changes .
She was initially treated for heart failure and pneumonia and , on the night of admission , she experienced a fever to 104 , acute respiratory distress and required intubation for two days .
The patient was noted to have a CPK of 150 with 11.8 percent MB but no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .
She was treated for congestive heart failure and was diuresed and extubated .
She was transferred to the floor where initially she did very well but subsequently developed an elevated BUN and creatinine and failure to eat .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter requested that she be transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> where she had been cared for in the past for her myocardial infarction as well as cerebrovascular disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is notable for congestive heart failure with a last ejection fraction noted to be 28 percent in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1997 .
She also has a history of urinary tract infection .
She has a history of diverticulosis with lower GI bleeds .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/95 she was admitted with a cerebral vascular accident notable for right facial droop and left-sided weakness .
There was marked improvement in these symptoms thereafter , and the patient was discharged on Coumadin which was subsequently discontinued .
The patient also has a history of myocardial infarction in 1977 and 1987 and underwent a coronary artery bypass grafting X4 in 1987 .
She also has a history of polymyalgia rheumatica with a bilateral temporal artery being biopsied and being negative for temporal arteritis .
She also has a history of right proximal femur fracture and internal fixation in 1995 .
On arrival to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> the patient stated that she had not had a bowel movement for many days and that she had no appetite .
However , she denied any chest pain , dyspnea or syncope .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination her pulse was 55 .
Her systolic blood pressure was 110 .
She appeared to be very dry with very dry mucosa .
Her lungs had few rhonchi , no rales .
Her cardiac exam was irregular but her heart sounds were distant .
Her abdomen showed active bowel sounds , was nontender and she had no pedal edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory data was notable for hematocrit of 33.5 , white count of 14.7 , platelet count of 270 .
BUN 112 , creatinine 2.3 , sodium 142 , potassium 4.2 , CO2 23.4 , and chloride 104 .
A chest x-ray revealed clear lungs on a portable chest x-ray without evidence of pneumonia or pulmonary edema .
A KUB showed a large loop of dilated bowel but no free air and a tortuous calcified aorta .
An electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with evidence of an old inferior myocardial infarction and right bundle branch block .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 25</PHI> where she was hydrated for the presumed diagnosis of pre-renal azotemia .
A urinalysis was notable for pyuria with 50 to 100 white cells , and the patient was begun on Levofloxacin for presumed polymicrobial urinary tract infection .
A head CT scan was performed which showed multiple old ischemic infarcts in the right frontal and cerebellar lobes .
There was diffuse atrophy and no evidence of recent bleed .
The patient was evaluated by the rheumatology service who noted that the patient &apos;s diagnosis was most consistent with rheumatoid arthritis and possibly PMR .
The patient had been followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time she was noted to have undergone bilateral temporal artery biopsies , both of which were negative for temporal arteritis .
The recommendation from the rheumatology service was to attempt to decrease her Prednisone to 5 mg PO q.day with an eye on a change in the severity of her shoulder arthritis symptoms .
On the third hospital day the patient developed a sudden change in her mental status while taking pills .
She was noted to be arousable and responsive and minimally conversation .
However , she was unable to move her right arm or leg .
Her eyes were deviated to the left and she had a right facial droop .
The patient was taken to the emergent CAT scan which revealed no acute bleeding and was felt to be a cerebral vascular occlusion .
The patient was evaluated by the Stroke Service , which recommended a lumbar puncture which was performed and did not reveal evidence of meningitis .
A cardiac ultrasound was performed which revealed an ejection fraction of 50 percent with wall motion abnormalities in the inferior septal and inferior walls involving the apex .
There was trace mitral regurgitation .
Multiple aortic valve leaflets were thickened without stenosis .
There was no evidence of an intraventricular thrombus .
The patient was initially treated by increasing her aspirin from 81 mg to 325 mg .
She was also continued to be hydrated .
Her blood pressure medications were held to allow increased cerebral perfusion .
After careful discussion with the neurology service , it was felt that the patient was at too great a risk to be started and maintained on anticoagulant therapy and therefore she was treated conservatively .
The patient was subsequently evaluated by the speech pathology service , the physical therapy service and the occupational therapy service for evaluation for her recovery from her stroke .
Her BUN and creatinine continued to decrease with hydration and Zestril was re-initiated and , as her blood pressure allowed , her Isordil was re-initiated and then her Zestril was increased to 10 mg PO q.day .
Digoxin was discontinued because of her improved left ventricular ejection fraction .
The patient did have a steady decrease in her hematocrit to a minimum of 26.2 and received one unit of packed red blood cells with restoration of her hematocrit over 30 .
Her ferritin was 83 and there was no evidence of guaiac positive stools .
It was elected to defer further evaluation of her anemia at this time .
However , if she became more evidently guaiac positive it would be appropriate to evaluate the source of bleeding in her colon and potentially in her esophagus and stomach .
Nevertheless , the patient was switched from aspirin to Plavix 75 mg PO q.day in view of her history of lower GI bleeding .
Major consideration toward the end of the patient &apos;s hospitalization was whether or not she would be able to take adequate PO intake to maintain her volume status .
Initially it was felt that the patient would require gastroscopy .
However , with the assistance of the patient &apos;s granddaughter , the patient was able to increase her po intake with a lot of assistance .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter felt that it was likely that her PO intake would improve when she returned home to the nursing home .
I discussed this with the granddaughter and told her that if her PO intake was inadequate , that gastrostomy tube would be reasonable in the future and that we would be available to assist in this as it became necessary .
The patient was evaluated by the GI service who thought that a PEG would be quite feasible and that they would be delighted to do this if it was necessary and the patient and family agreed .
Nevertheless , we have decided to postpone this issue for now and to see how she does when she returns to the nursing home .
The patient will be transferred tomorrow to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Naplesvillechaelty</PHI> .
I will get in touch with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Areas</PHI> and please do not hesitate to contact me if I can provide any additional information .

However she is followed by a Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> .
She was in her usual state of health until one day prior to admission when she felt increasing fatigue , nausea and vomiting productive of bright red blood and coffee ground emesis .
She also had some black , tarry stool in her colostomy bag .
At <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> , she had a hematocrit of 25 and was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells .
She had an upper endoscopy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> showing an esophagus filled with clots and small amount of bleeding varices , clot in the stomach with antral gastritis , and a normal duodenum .
She was started on Pitressin , a Blakemore tube was inserted .
She was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Intensive Care Unit where on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 25</PHI> in the morning her hematocrit was found to be 27.4 .
She was transfused another 2 units of packed red blood cells over the course of the day and her hematocrit improved to 29.4 and then 31.2 .
The GI service was consulted and an upper endoscopy study showed grade III varices with no active bleeding and a clean base gastric ulcer possibly secondary to the Blakemore tube .
Her varices had stigmata of recent bleeding , were banded successfully .
after the procedure and 2 more units of packed red blood cells , the patient was hemodynamically stable and hematocrit was stable at 31.2 .

LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for sodium 141 , potassium 4.2 , chloride 109 , bicarb 19.8 , BUN 38 , creatinine 1.2 and glucose 388 .
She had a pneumonia of 31 , calcium was 7.5 , phosphorous 3.0 , magnesium 1.3 .
Her bilirubin was 1.4 total , 0.2 direct .
alkaline phosphatase 101 .
SGPT 22 , SGOT 41 , amylase 31 , lipase less than 1 .
LDH was 38.9 , CK was 66 , her hematocrit was 27.4 , white count was 8.0 and her platelets were 55 .
PT was 14.5 , PTT 25.5 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
As described above the patient was transfused an additional 2 units in the Intensive Care Unit and the patient also received an upper endoscopy study and her varices were banded .
On transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lemgarson Hospital</PHI> service , her hematocrit was 31.2 , white count 11.1 and a platelet count 80 .
Her PT was 13.1 , PTT 26.7 .
The rest of her labs were unremarkable .
She was watched very closely while on the floor .
She was on GI bleed precautions at all times , was too large for IV .
She had a clot at the blood bank and she had BID hematocrits checked .
She was kept NPO until <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> when she began to feel hungry .
At that time clear liquids were started .
All of her stools were guaiaced .
She also began Nadolol 40 mg QD to reduce her portal hypertension .
The GI consult team continued to follow her .
We also tried to contact her physician at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and was unsuccessful .
Therefore we decided to work up her cirrhosis .
She was described as having _______ cirrhosis and we decided that we wanted to try to figure out the etiology .
Her ferritin and iron studies did not reveal any evidence of hemochromatosis and her hep serologies were all negative .
She also had negative antimitochondrial antibody and she also had no evidence of ceruloplasmin .
Over the course of her admission were also sent an alpha-1-antitrypsin , which was negative .
She did very well over the course of her admission with no evidence of further bleeding .
Her hematocrit stayed stable at approximately 32 .
We also did an ultrasound guided paracentesis .
The peritoneal fluid showed a glucose of 244 , total protein 0.8 and a albumin of 0.5 , globulin 0.3 , amylase 16 , LDH of 51 .
The serum albumin gradient was 1.8 consistent with portal hypertension .
The cell count showed a white blood cell count of 160 with 16% polys .
She therefore _________ criteria for a spontaneous bacterial peritonitis .
Her platelet count stayed persistently low and we decided that it might be due to Cimetidine .
Therefore we switched her Cimetidine to Prilosec .
By the <PHI TYPE="DATE">2th</PHI> the patient was feeling very well and desired to transfer or discharge to home .
She wanted to be closer to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">North Dakota</PHI> .
After discussion with her private physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Joasscchird</PHI> , tel. <PHI TYPE="PHONE">090-249-6079</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Va Sit Namar Healthcare</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Do Of Hospital</PHI> , the patient was judged to be fit for discharge and she was sent home with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">AH</PHI> and physical therapy .
She was quite able to climb stairs on her own in the hospital .
She is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Acrookesjo</PHI> in one week and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Work</PHI> the gastrointestinal fellow here at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> in 2 weeks .
She may require a repeat upper endoscopy study to see if she needs any rebanding .
The patient however complained of a persistent wheeze with beta blocker , therefore it was agreed that we would stop the beta blocker until the patient was followed up as an outpatient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Zoloft 50 mg PO QD , Lactulose 15 g PO BID , Synthroid 0.15 mg PO QD , Prilosec 20 mg PO BID .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 75 year old female with a history of psychotic depression with paranoia who presents status post a few days of incontinence , increased confusion , and collapse .
The patient who has a baseline mental status / psychiatric impairment was reported to be increasingly confused and paranoid over the past few days .
She was reportedly incontinent of urine and diaphoretic .
The family also reported that the patient &quot; collapsed &quot; one day prior to admission , as her legs gave out .
Her PO intake has also decreased .
She was brought to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Ward by ambulance , where she was found to be confused , oriented to self and family only , and with dry mucous membranes .
The head computerized tomography scan on admission to the emergency room revealed moderate to severe cortical atrophy without evidence of acute bleed or subdural hemorrhage .
The patient denies shortness of breath , chest pain or abdominal pain .
The patient has a history of major depression / psychotic depression since at least 1988 .
She does have paranoid features .
The patient has a history of near syncope in 1988 and also a history of dehydration .
Currently the patient is unable to provide history .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As outlined above .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
vitamin B12 shots monthly .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with elderly siblings .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Mother with depression .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Elderly obese woman lying comfortably in bed in no acute distress .
The vital signs revealed blood pressure 150/83 , heart rate 84 , respirations 20 per minute and temperature 98.8 degrees Fahrenheit .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat examination was unremarkable .
The lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion bilaterally .
Heart :
regular rate and rhythm with normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
revealed one plus edema bilaterally .
The neurological examination revealed that the patient was alert and oriented only to self .
She answers inappropriately to questions .
She is not cooperative with the full neurological examination but she did move all four extremities .
LABORATORY DATA :
revealed sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 106 , bicarbonate 26.4 , BUN 21 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose was 124 .
The amylase was 37 .
The complete blood count revealed a white blood cell count of 11,900 ; hematocrit of 38 and platelet count of 207,000 ; the tox screen was negative .
The prothrombin time was 10.1 and partial thromboplastin time 28.5 .
The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm at 78 with axis of 0 degrees and normal intervals .
There were no ST-T wave changes .
Head computerized tomography scan revealed diffuse cortical atrophy , increased ventricles and no acute bleed .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Dehydration .
The patient was mildly dehydrated at time of admission and was replaced with intravenous fluids until she began taking good PO intake .
By the end of her hospitalization she was eating well on her own .
2. Infectious Disease .
Admission urinalysis revealed 5-10 red blood cells , 10-20 white blood cells and few bacteria .
Therefore the patient was started on Bactrim for urinary tract infection .
She did not tolerate oral medication initially and was switched to intravenous ampicillin .
The antibiotics were discontinued after three days of intravenous antibiotic therapy .
A repeat urinalysis done later in the course of the hospitalization revealed no white blood cells .
3. Psychiatric .
The patient underwent neuropsychiatric testing .
This evaluation revealed a woman with multifaceted loss of intellectual functioning who falls well within the range of SDAT group .
Conclusion was that this was a dementing process .
The testing was performed by a staff neuropsychologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lornsook Trusmoag</PHI> , PhD , telephone number <PHI TYPE="PHONE">959-1490</PHI> .
She stated that she would be happy to reevaluate Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fleetheesc</PHI> in the future if necessary .
4. Parotid swelling .
Approximately five days into the hospital stay it was noted that the patient had significant right parotid swelling .
Plain films revealed soft tissue swelling , neck and face computerized tomography scan revealed a nonspecific enlarged right parotid gland with increased attenuation consistent with an inflammatory or neoplastic process .
The patient had refused intravenous contrast so a contrast study was not available .
The patient was evaluated by ENT who felt that her enlargement was more likely secondary to an inflammatory process although they could not rule out malignancy .
They recommended that a cytology sample be obtained and sent and that the patient be treated with a 14 day course of Keflex .
Cytology consult was called , but by the time the cytologist came to do a fine needle aspiration the mass had shrunken to the point where there was nothing to aspirate .
It was felt that attempting a biopsy and beginning antibiotic treatment was not indicated at this time as the mass had entirely resolved .
The ENT physician who saw the patient is Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> .
The patient was scheduled to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freieslowkays</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 8</PHI> , 1994 at 1:20 p.m. at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Purckecation Balpoingdelt Pabarnes- Campa Memorial Hospital</PHI> .
The phone number is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">610-7597</PHI> .
5. Physical Therapy .
The patient &apos;s baseline is that she is able to walk with the assistance of her brother or sister at home .
However , she has been reluctant to even move from the bed to the chair since admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
Physical Therapy has been working with her .
Fear of falling seems to be a large component of this , and the patient will likely need considerable patience in convincing her it is okay to get out of bed again .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
vitamin B12 shots q. month , Colace 100 mg PO t.i.d. and Carafate one gram PO q.i.d.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS :
CHRONIC LYMPHOCYTIC LEUKEMIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 73-year-old white man status post coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 admitted for catheterization for evaluation of the current anginal symptoms and a positive exercise tolerance test .
The patient had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 because of unstable angina with LIMA to the LAD and SVG to the OMB and PDA .
The patient was free of angina until six weeks prior to admission when he began to have anginal symptoms described as a heaviness beginning in the scapula , moving to the retrosternal chest and radiating to the left shoulder with no other associated symptoms .
These anginal episodes occurred after exercise and also at rest resolving in two to five minutes .
An exercise tolerance test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/92 was stopped at seven minutes because of fatigue and chest pain .
There were positive EKG changes in the inferolateral leads and thallium showed a reversible ischemia in the inferoapical region .
Addition of diltiazem to the patient &apos;s aspirin and Dyazide medical treatment had no improvement in symptoms .
The patient had no symptoms of congestive heart failure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia .
The patient started Leukorin treatment two days prior to admission for a white count of 100,000 .
Hypertension .
Hyperlipidemia .
Left total hip replacement in 1988 .
Low back pain .
Right internal carotid artery stenosis of 80-90% diagnosed by carotid noninvasives after an episode of amaurosis fugax .
Gout .
Skin cancer .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day ; Levoxine , 0.1 mg q day ; Leukorin , 2 mg two po q a.m.
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Negative except for increasing fatigue in the past two weeks and leg cramps at night .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a blood pressure of 158/88 .
Pulse 70 .
Temperature 97.4 .
Respiratory rate 18 .
Physical examination was significant for ulcerated fungating lesions on his left ear , dorsum of his hands .
There was a right carotid bruit .
Lungs were clear .
Cardiovascular exam revealed a regular rate and rhythm with S1 , S2 , S4 without murmurs .
Spleen was felt 4 cm below the costal margin .
The liver was 10 cm by percussion .
There were palpable inguinal lymph nodes .
Pulses were 1-2+ bilaterally .
Neurological exam was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission included a white blood cell count of 77.8 with 82% lymphs .
Hematocrit 35.2 .
Platelet count 104,000 .
BUN / creatinine 26/1.4 .
Potassium 4.4 .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , normal axis and intervals , no changes from previous EKG , no signs of ischemia or infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent a diagnostic cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/2</PHI>/92 which showed the following :
Pressures RA 9/4 , RV 24/7 , PA 24/12 with a mean of 14 , PCW 12/9 with a mean of 10 .
Cardiac output 6.7 .
Cardiac index 3.2 .
SVR 943 .
Angiography showed an occluded SVG graft to OM1 , patent SVG graft to the RCA , patent LIMA to the LAD .
There was also 50% occlusion of the left proximal circumflex , 95% occlusion of the right proximal coronary artery , 50% occlusion of the OMB1 , 90% occlusion of the mid LAD .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The patient then underwent PTCA of the distal RCA lesion .
Because of difficulty passing the wire through the graft to the RCA , the proximal 95% RCA lesion was dilated first and then the distal RCA lesion was dilated .
The patient received 600 cc of contrast and the PTCA procedure took approximately three hours .
The patient did not experience any chest pain during the procedure and has not had any chest pain since the procedure .
The sheaths were removed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 and heparin was restarted four hours after sheath removal and maintained for two days because of a possible small dissection in the RCA .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit was 25 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/4</PHI>/92 .
Repeat hematocrit showed it to be stable at 27 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/5</PHI> .
It was thought that the drop in hematocrit was secondary to his chemotherapy , some small dilutional effect and small blood loss from the PTCA , although there was no evidence of significant bleeding .
The patient was asymptomatic except for some back pain from lying flat after the catheterization procedures .
His vital signs remained stable .
He is to be discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/6</PHI> with follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kote</PHI> , his cardiologist and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Right</PHI> , his hematologist .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS :
On discharge included Levoxine , 0.1 mg po q day ; diltiazem CD , 240 mg po q day ; Isordil , 5 mg po t.i.d. ; aspirin , one po q.o.d. ; Leukeran , 2 mg po two q a.m. ; Dyazide , one po q.o.d. ; allopurinol , 300 mg po q day .
The patient was discharged to home in stable condition .

The patient was admitted to the hospital for ureteral stent placement .
On the day of admission , she was generally stable and she had no evidence of disease in the pelvis , no bleeding and no other abnormality .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jescdrig</PHI> was called and a consultation was done and he placed bilateral ureteral stents in her kidneys .
Postoperatively , she diuresed very well .
She had dropped her BUN and creatinine to normal and she was found to have may be metastatic disease to her skin on the right paraumbilical area .
Because of her age and mental condition and the fact that she had cerebral atrophy , the decision was made for comfort unless she has any further problem and no further chemotherapy or treatment will be given .
The possibility that she may need to receive radiation therapy to this area to prevent her from getting further obstruction was also brought up .
Her family felt that at the present time , because her condition was no good , they would like to just take her home so that she could enjoy the quality of life .
Indeed , at the time of discharge she was conscious and she was cooperative and she was able to communicate very nicely with everyone including her family , except for the mental instability that she had because of her cerebral atrophy due to senility .
FOLLOW-UP :
She will be followed in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Centu Fairgmer Queen Medical Center</PHI> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52 year old right hand dominant white female who presented with recurrent tumor in the left CP angle and middle fossa .
She is followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Brendniungand Fossa</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Telshey Swatlleebtik</PHI> .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Her past medical history is unremarkable until 1977 when she developed left eye and face pain , accompanied by numbness .
A computerized tomography scan was felt to be normal .
In 1989 , she started developing incoordination in her left upper extremity .
A magnetic resonance imaging study at that time revealed a left CPA tumor with pontine compression .
This tumor was partially resected in <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 with nondiagnostic pathology , finally labeled as a hamartoma .
She was followed with serial imaging studies .
She had developed increasing tumor growth and increasing symptoms over the past three months , consisting of decreased ambulation , frequent falls and unable to get up the stairs of a bus due to proximal weakness .
She also noticed loss of balance .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/93 , she had a magnetic resonance imaging study that revealed a large complex extra-axial mass centered in the left CPA with marked mass effect on the brainstem , left temporal lobe and the left parapharyngial space .
There was no change compared with a previous study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/92 .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was positive for an injury to the right third finger with a soiled razor blade .
Wound was clean .
No tetanus shot had been received .

On neurological examination , she was alert with normal cognitive function .
Her affect is a bit anxious .
Her pupils equal , round , reactive to light and accommodation , 4 to 2 millimeters , direct and consensually .
Fields were full , extra ocular movements were full with bilateral end gaze nystagmus .
Sensory to the face was markedly diminished to pin prick , light touch and temperature over V1 and V2 and to a lesser degree V3 .
There was a minimal corneal reflex and no response to nasal tickle on the left .
Motor to the face was intact .
Vision was intact bilaterally .
Jaw was strong .
Hearing was intact on the right , severely limited on the left .
Palate and tongue were midline .
Head was turned well to the right , decreased somewhat to the left and gag was present bilaterally .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
MICU COURSE-The patient was continued on Bactrim at 15 mg / kg per day in divided doses for his PCP pneumonia .
The patient was switched from p.o. Prednisone to IV Solu-Medrol at equivalent therapeutic doses .
The patient &apos;s respiratory wheezes were treated symptomatically with bronchodilators .
The patient &apos;s anemia was treated with folate , iron , and vitamin B-12 .
The patient was noted to be agitated at times with acute oxygen desaturations at these times .
The patient was started on a Morphine drip for control .
The patient &apos;s peak inspiratory pressures were noted to be elevated , consistent with an ARDS picture .
The patient was therefore started on pressure controlled ventilation resulting in a decrease in his PIP from 60 to 45 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/10</PHI>/91 , the patient was noted to have an acutely diminished white count at 2.0 with a hematocrit of 32.0 .
The patient was also noted to have decreased urine output with an acute increase in his creatinine from 1.5 to 2.2 .
Despite improvement in his chest x-ray noted on that day which was believed to be attributable to the steroids , the patient was switched to IV Pentamidine given the possibility of myelosuppression by Bactrim .
Consultation with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Test</PHI> led to a plan to begin aerosolized Pentamidine 100 mg nebilized q.d. for three days while therapeutic levels of Pentamidine could be build up in the lungs via IV .
However , the patient was noted to become increasingly hypotensive with decreased urine output .
The patient became anuric with increasing metabolic acidosis .
The patient was started on Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 hours for presumed sepsis .
Despite this measure , the patient became increasingly hypotensive requiring the addition of Dopamine and Levophed drips .
The patient &apos;s condition deteriorated overnight with increasing metabolic acidosis despite bicarbonate .
The patient &apos;s oliguria renal failure continued despite fluid boluses and diuretics .
The patient &apos;s electrolytes became increasingly difficult to manage with hyperkalemia , hyperphosphatemia , and hypocalcemia .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11</PHI>/91 , the patient &apos;s blood pressure dropped to 60/palpable despite the addition of Neo-Synephrine .
At this time , his arterial blood gas revealed a pH of 7.07 , and the patient became aystolic .
The patient was subsequently declared dead at 7:58 A.M.
Medications at the time of death :
Pentamidine 100 mg nebulized q.d. times three days , Pentamidine 300 mg IV q.d. , Solu-Medrol 20 mg IV t.i.d. , Timentin 3.1 grams IV q4 , Morphine sulfate drip at 5 mg / hour IV , Dopamine drip 18 mcg / kg/min IV drip , Pavulon 2 mg IV q1hour , Levophef 16 mcg / min IV drip , ferrous sulfate 324 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , Folate 1 mg per NG tube q.d. , vitamin B-12 , Colace , vitamin K , senna .

She was staged as lB and pathology showed a small cell neuroendocrine tumor of the cervix .
She underwent a radical hysterectomy .
There were positive margins and positive nodes .
in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 , she had a vaginal apex mass on examination .
Cystoscopy and proctoscopy were negative .
A CT , however , confirmed a large pelvic mass with bilateral hydronephrosis .
A biopsy of the mass revealed poorly differentiated metastatic small cell neuroendocrine tumor .
Between <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l990 , she received two cycles of chemotherapy in two parts alternating Cisplatin and VP-l6 with Vincristine , Cytoxan , and Adriamycin .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of l990 , she underwent radiation therapy and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , a right ventriculogram showed an ejection fraction of 48% .
Her chemotherapy was then changed to a single agent of Cytoxan .
Also in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , she had right hip pain .
There was a bony metastasis .
Orthopedic Surgeons did an open reduction and internal fixation of a lytic lesion involving the right femur .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 30</PHI> through <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 4</PHI> of l99l , she received her first cycle of Ifosfamide and Mesna .
She had prolonged neutropenia and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 28</PHI> , she was admitted with a headache .
CT scan at that time was normal .
She had non-focal findings per the Neurology Service .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 6</PHI> , she began the next cycle of second line chemotherapy consisting of Carboplatin , Ifosfamide , and Mesna .
Since the last cycle of chemotherapy , she has had continued right hip pain and right mid lateral abdominal discomfort .
She also had complaint of a left perineal rash over the last two weeks .
She was started on Zovirax on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 3</PHI> .
She presents for a bone scan , blood transfusion , and consideration of her third cycle of second line chemotherapy .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Radical hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of l989 , open reduction and internal fixation of femur in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> of l99l , and examination under anesthesia , cystoscopy , and proctoscopy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> of l990 .
PAST OBSTETRICAL HISTORY :
Spontaneous vaginal delivery times three .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Zovirax 200 mg five times daily , Methadone 50 mg t.i.d. , and Ativan p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure was ll0/70 , heart rate 84 , and temperature 97.4 .
HEENT :
No thyromegaly .
CHEST :
Clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm .
there was no distinct costovertebral angle tenderness .
ABDOMEN :
Slightly distended .
There was mild tenderness to palpation in the right mid lateral abdomen .
There were no peritoneal signs and no guarding .
There were normal bowel sounds .
EXTREMITIES :
Without edema .
PELVIC :
By Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> revealed regrowth of the pelvic tumor .
There was a dry scaly rash with multiple small scabs on the left perineum and posterior thigh .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Her electrolytes were within normal limits , her BUN was ll , and creatinine was 0.8 .
Her ALT was l0 , total bilirubin 0.4 , and magnesium was l.8 .
Her admission CBC revealed a white blood count of 2.27 , with 56 polys and 3 bands .
Her hematocrit was 22.9 and platelets were l24 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for bone scan and blood transfusion as well as consideration of further chemotherapy .
The bone scan was performed which revealed multiple metastases to the spine , ribs , and skull .
There was noted , however , to be new pain in the right shoulder and , in fact , there was a lytic lesion involving the right shoulder and femur .
Plain film revealed a moth-eaten appearance consistent with probable new metastases .
The Radiation Service was consulted and noted that past areas treated including her right femur , her thoracic spine , pelvis , and right posterior ribs had all responded to radiation therapy and agreed that treating the right shoulder humerus and the right hip which had not been previously treated was reasonable .
Planning for further radiation therapy was arranged for next week by the Radiation Service .
She was also seen by the Dermatology Service who examined the rash and felt it was most likely a contact dermatitis .
She was given Synalar Cream and Eucerin Cream as a moisturizer .
The patient also received a unit of donor direct blood .
Due to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Friednantflirt</PHI> &apos;s concern that the tumor was growing despite the available chemotherapeutic regimen , the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> Medical Oncology Service was consulted .
They noted , as well , that she had failed the most active agents against small cell carcinomas .
However , they felt that at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Venbonlea Health</PHI> , there were several possible options including a possible phase I trial regimen .
The plan at this time was made to further consider the options and the patient will follow-up with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Im Villtro University Medical Center</PHI> next week .
On the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/26</PHI>/06 , the patient was discharged home in stable condition .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 69-year-old male with a long history of alcohol abuse , withdrawal seizures , and hypopharyngeal cancer now admitted with foreign body in hypopharynx .
The patient has a long history of alcohol abuse and alcoholic liver disease as well as seizure disorder related to alcohol withdrawal and multiple <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> admissions for detox and multiple detox facilities in the past .
The patient also recently ( <PHI TYPE="DATE">06</PHI>/93 ) was diagnosed with infiltrating cancer of the hypopharynx and was scheduled to undergo XRT but had not yet started .
Recently the patient noticed hoarseness secondary to vocal cord involvement of the tumor .
On the day of admission the patient was in a detox center undergoing detox prior to beginning his XRT and was in his usual state of health at that time when he had the acute onset of coughing after swallowing some chicken a la king .
The patient also was noted to have secretions draining from his mouth .
He denied any shortness of breath at that time .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Stamgibonnole Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation .
In the Emergency Room the patient underwent EGD by GI where a large piece of chicken was visualized at the level of the cricopharyngeus .
Despite multiple attempts at extraction at that point they were unable to extract the foreign body and it was felt that the patient should be admitted and attempt extraction later in the afternoon .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Alcohol abuse complicated by hepatitis , cirrhosis , seizure disorder , encephalopathy .
2) History of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Hypertension .
4) Hypopharyngeal cancer .
5) Chronic right lower lobe opacity on chest x-ray noted to be probable scarring vs. fat pad .
6) Question of internal capsule CVA on CT scan .
ALLERGIES :
Penicillin , shellfish , Doxycycline , also the patient had rash with Ceclor .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer included Dilantin 100 mg po t.i.d. , Ceclor , Motrin , Percocet p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission he is a disheveled elderly male uncooperative with the exam .
Vital signs revealed the patient was afebrile , blood pressure 150/90 , pulse 86 and regular , respiratory rate 24 , and oxygen saturation 91% on room air .
HEENT exam revealed sclerae were injected , pupils equal and reactive .
Neck exam no JVD or lymphadenopathy .
Chest exam coarse upper airway sounds , no rales .
Cardiovascular exam regular rate and rhythm without murmur .
Abdominal exam obese , hypoactive bowel sounds , non-tender , some guarding , no rebound tenderness .
Extremities with trace pedal edema , 1 to 2+ dorsalis pedis pulses .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission Hct 42.1 , white count 7.6 , platelets 132 .
Dilantin level 13.7 .
SMA 7 was unremarkable aside from a glucose of 173 and a potassium of 3.1 .
LFTs revealed ALT of 44 , AST of 36 , LDH of 277 , alk phos 155 , total bili 0.7 , and direct bili 0.4. Total protein 7.2 , albumin 3.7 , calcium 9.3. PT and PTT were 13.3 and 23.5 respectively .
UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By systems -
1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .
Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .
EGD was performed .
Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .
There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .
The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .
The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .
The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .
Other GI issues include the patient &apos;s hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .
2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .
Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .
3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .
A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .
Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .
The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .
He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient &apos;s mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .
Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient &apos;s poor prognosis for the future .
The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient &apos;s nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .
It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .
4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .
The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/22</PHI>/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .
The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .
However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .
The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .
No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .
5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .
It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .
He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .
The patient continued to be asymptomatic .
6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .
The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .
These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .
Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .
7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .
It was decided the patient &apos;s code status would not be DNR , DNI .
8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .
He underwent extraction of all his teeth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .
Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .
CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .
The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .
The last PT and PTT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/26</PHI>/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .
The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 .
The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">09/27</PHI>/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .
A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .
OPERATIVE PROCEDURES :
Extraction of all remaining teeth under general anesthesia on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/21</PHI>/93 .
COMPLICATIONS :
1) Aspiration pneumonia .
2) GI bleed .
3) Ileus secondary to general anesthesia for above operation .
DISPOSITION :
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient is stable on discharge .
The patient is to be transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Paw.ryfear Medical Center</PHI> for further care including physical therapy , occupational therapy , and further nutritional support .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Pepcid 20 mg po IV b.i.d. for history of gastritis and GI bleed , heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. ( this may be discontinued as the patient becomes more mobile and active ) , tube feeds with Jevity at 75 cc / hour full strength-please check residuals .
Feeding tube should be flushed q4h with 20 to 30 cc of warm water to prevent clogging of feeding tube .

The patient developed shortness of breath at home and the EMTs were called and the patient was found to be in respiratory distress .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Gobay Hos Memorial Hospital</PHI> where chest x-ray showed left lower lobe infiltrate and cardiac enzymes were elevated with a CK of 297 , MB fraction of 38 and troponin of 12 .
The patient was transferred to the medicine service at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and underwent cardiac catheterization which was negative for disease .
He continued to complain of shortness of breath with an episode of respiratory failure in the hospital requiring 100% nonrebreather .
Neurology was consulted for difficulty lifting his arms .
On consultation the patient admitted to dysphasia and periods of diplopia in the past .
The patient was found to have weakness in the proximal muscles as well as the capability of the muscles .
He was started on IV ig and IV Solu-Medrol for a diagnosis of myasthenia gravis given his past history of thymoma .
He markedly improved after a dose of Mestinon .
He completed a five-day course of IV ig .
His work up included acetylcholine esterase , receptor antibodies , thyroglobulin antibody is pending .
An ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative .
Sed rate was 58 and repeat 75 .
EMG studies were performed , the result is pending at the time of this dictation .
He also had a repeat chest CT which showed a question of recurrence of the thymoma .
Thoracic Surgery was consulted and recommended repeating the CT scan in six weeks as an outpatient .

A diastolic murmur was noted by one listener .
Abdomen had mild right upper quadrant tenderness with positive bowel sounds .
Rectal was guaiac positive .
Extremities had marked pitting edema bilaterally .
Right heel ulcer with eschar .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Plasma sodium 134 , plasma carbon dioxide 34.8 , blood urea nitrogen 67 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 165 , liver function tests were normal .
Amylase 473 , lipase 6.8 , white blood cell count 7.4 , hematocrit 32.4 , platelets 222 .
Urine analysis showed no urinary tract infection .
Chest x-ray showed no pulmonary edema or infiltrate and minimal linear atelectasis in the right mid lung zone .
KUB showed no bowel obstruction .
Electrocardiogram had normal sinus rhythm with no changes compared with prior electrocardiogram .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By system .
1. ENDOCRINE :
The patient &apos;s seizure was thought to be secondary to hypoglycemia in the setting of decreased oral intake on her standard anti-glycemic medications .
She will be transferred back to her long term care facility on a CZI sliding scale for close management of her sugars pending further assessment of her baseline anti-glycemic medication needs .
2. NEUROLOGICAL :
The patient has a history of transient ischemic attacks in the past .
Her seizure was thought secondary to hypoglycemia and she had no further seizure activity in the hospital .
She did have some slightly paranoid behavior which her son says is typical .
She was continued on her Trazodone , Neurontin and Zyprexa .
3. CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient had an echocardiogram which revealed a normal ejection fraction , no wall motion abnormalities but mitral stenosis with peak gradient of 19 and mean gradient of 9 , dilated right ventricle , dilated right atrium , and right ventricle systolic pressure in the 60s .
She was aggressively diuresed and her shortness of breath somewhat improved as did her pedal edema .
After discussion with her primary care physician it was decided that she would have further cardiology assessment as an outpatient .
4. PULMONARY :
The patient was extubated quickly after her admission and maintained good oxygen saturation .
She was aggressively diuresed for her minimal congestive heart failure .
5. GASTROINTESTINAL :
The patient had guaiac positive stools and had an elevated amylase without an elevated lipase .
These findings suggest some bowel pathology .
The patient is known to have had an upper gastrointestinal bleed in 1997 in the context of Coumadin .
An outpatient gastrointestinal workup may be indicated .
6. RENAL :
The patient maintained her baseline creatinine which reflects chronic renal insufficiency secondary to her diabetes .
7. INFECTIOUS DISEASE :
The patient was treated on Unasyn for concern of cellulitis .
The patient &apos;s lower extremities were bilaterally erythematous consistent with chronic venous stasis .
However she did have a low grade temperature to 100F and it was thought that given her diabetes and ulcer on her heel she should be covered for possible cellulitis .
She will be discharged on a one week course of Augmentin .
The patient was discharged to her chronic care facility on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/27</PHI>/99 in stable condition .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , transverse colostomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Daie Elms</PHI> was a 50-year-old male , who underwent cadaveric renal transplant in 1992 , who presented with a three-week old scrape of the right popliteal fossa related to a prosthesis .
The wound became progressively indurated with drainage , and he presented for evaluation and treatment .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ; hypertension ; peripheral vascular disease ; coronary artery disease ; bilateral vitrectomies ; cadaveric renal transplant ; suprapubic tube for ureteral necrosis ; status post right below-knee amputation and left below-knee amputation ; asthma ; atrial fibrillation ; left arm arteriovenous fistula .

No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
NPH insulin .
Cyclosporin A .
Prednisone .
Procardia .
Minipress .
Digoxin .
Pravachol .
Imuran .
Lasix .
Epogen .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an obese man in no acute distress .
His blood pressure was 174/60 ; temperature 103.4 .
The head , eyes , ears , nose and throat examination was remarkable for poor dentition .
The neck was supple without adenopathy .
The chest examination was remarkable for coarse breath sounds bilaterally , with regular rate and rhythm on cardiac examination .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender and obese .
The genitourinary examination was notable for a suprapubic tube in place with normal male genitalia and guaiac negative stools on rectal examination .
Extremity examination revealed bilateral below-knee amputations with a 2 x 4 centimeter area of inflammation in the right popliteal fossa with a draining sinus .
Neurological examination was grossly nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
At the time of admission , BUN and creatinine were 89 and 4.4 ; white blood count 19.3 ; hematocrit 21.9 ; PT 15.1 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was admitted to the hospital , and after multiple cultures were drawn , he was subsequently taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/21</PHI>/96 for incision and drainage of a right thigh abscess .
There appeared to be a component of necrotizing fasciitis to this , and he was taken back to the operating room the next day for incision and drainage of a pelvic abscess and intraabdominal abscess .
Cultures from his abdomen subsequently grew out methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas .
His clinical condition continued to worsen with evidence of ongoing sepsis and renal failure , which transiently improved on hemodialysis , but generally progressively worsened .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/3</PHI>/96 , he underwent a transverse colostomy to allow diversion from the nonhealing leg and pelvis wounds .
A lengthy course ensued , during which time his renal function remained quite poor , and he had several intermittent septic episodes .
His nutrition remained poor throughout this time in spite of numerous attempts at enteral alimentation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/26</PHI>/96 , the patient had a hypotensive bradycardic arrest at the end of a dialysis run .
He was intubated at this time and could not be extubated thereafter .
He became increasingly more unresponsive and remained quite septic and febrile , resistant to aggressive antibiotic treatment .
His kidney function continued to deteriorate , and after extensive discussions with his sister and son , it was deemed appropriate to begin withdrawing care .
Given that there appeared to be little hope for meaningful recovery to a point acceptable to the patient , the family agreed that withdrawing aggressive medical support was reasonable .
Over the next two days , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Elms</PHI> was kept comfortable and given intravenous fluids and tube feeds , but he remained extremely ill .
He continued to deteriorate until <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 , at which time he became bradycardic and asystolic .
He had no spontaneous cardiac or neurologic activity at this time , and he was declared dead at 12:15 A.M. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/96 .
The family was notified , but declined a postmortem examination .

Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a 57 year old white woman with mitral stenosis , atrial fibrillation , and cardiac risk factors including a positive family history , hypertension , and hypercholesterolemia who presented for catheterization because of progressive worsening of fatigue and dyspnea on exertion .
The patient was told that she had a heart murmur approximately twenty years ago .
However , she had been asymptomatic at that time .
She now gives a history of progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and fatigue which has become more incapacitating over the past several months .
She states that previously , she had been fairly active but now does not feel that she can do much of anything .
She denies chest pain but complains of episodes of light headedness accompanied by diaphoresis which occur at rest approximately once per week and last for several minutes .
She also complains of a tight feeling in her abdomen .
She also has had a cough for the past several years which is worse in the wintertime and is non-productive .
She denies hemoptysis , orthopnea , or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
She complains of ankle swelling for the past several months .
Her course has been complicated by atrial fibrillation first diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">New Years Eve</PHI> of l989 and she has been on Digoxin and Coumadin .
Because of her worsening symptoms , the patient had an echocardiogram at an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Chogejuan St.ver , New Hampshire</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of l989 which showed mitral stenosis .
She is now referred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for evaluation of her mitral valvular disease .
The patient &apos;s cardiac risk factors include a positive family history in that both parents died in their fifties of heart disease and two brothers had coronary artery bypass graft procedures in their thirties , hypercholesterolemia for several years , and hypertension .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
There is no history of rheumatic heart disease recalled by the patient , removal of benign lump in the left breast .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Coumadin 5 mg q.d. ( this was discontinued one week prior to admission ) , Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , Propranolol 20 mg q.d. , and Penicillin for dental procedures .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives with her husband in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Glendmin</PHI> .
She has four children , ages 22 through 27 , and works as a cook at a grammer school .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kotekoorsner</PHI> is a very pleasant woman who appears her stated age and is in no acute distress .
Vital signs showed that she had a blood pressure on the right which was l80/ll0 and a blood pressure on the left arm which was l84/ll0 , her pulse was 90 and was irregularly irregular , and her respirations were l6 per minute and were unlabored .
HEENT :
Unremarkable .
LUNGS :
Clear to auscultation and percussion .
CARDIAC :
Carotid arteries showed normal upstroke and volume without bruits bilaterally .
There was jugular venous distention to l7 cm at 45 degrees .
The point of maximal impulse was at the fifth intercostal space in the mid clavicular line .
There was a left parasternal lift .
There was a loud Sl and a physiologically split S2 with a prominent P2 component .
There was an opening snap immediately following the P2 .
There was a diastolic rumble at the apex which radiates to the axilla which is graded as a I / VI .
There was also a I / VI apical systolic murmur .
The patient &apos;s peripheral pulses were full .
There was no evidence of edema in the extremities .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , and there was a slight right upper quadrant fullness .
NEUROLOGICAL :
Non-focal .
However , there was evidence of subtle mental status change on the evening after the patient &apos;s valvuloplasty .
She was having difficulty remembering certain events which had occurred that day .
It was felt that because her neurological examination was non-focal at this time and that these changes represented no real change in her mental status from the time of admission , that no further work-up was required .
DISPOSITION :
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Nadalol 20 mg p.o. q.d. , Coumadin 5 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Mevacor 20 mg q.d. , and Digoxin 0.25 mg q.d.

HISTORY AND REASON FOR ADMISSION :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was a 56 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> for rule out pancreatic pseudocyst .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> had a past medical history which included Wegener &apos;s granulomatosis , history of an anterior myocardial infarction , and gallstone pancreatitis .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> with severe recurrent pancreatitis , nausea , vomiting , and abdominal pain .
His amylase on admission there was 1,961 .
The patient had two recent admissions for pancreatitis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1994 , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> 1994 .
On his current admission , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Free Medical Center</PHI> .
His amylase decreased to 51 , and the increased back to 151 on hospital day #10 .
At that time , he spiked a temperature to 103 .
He also became increasingly confused .
A computerized tomography scan done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/16</PHI>/95 showed a large &quot; pseudocyst &quot; .
He was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for further surgical evaluation .&apos;

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
In general , confused white man , in mild distress .
Vital signs :
Temperature was 102 , heart rate was 110 , respiratory rate was 22 , blood pressure was 113/63 .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat was benign .
His neck was supple .
Lungs :
Rales at the right base , bilateral decreased breath sounds at the bases .
Cor :
Regular rate and rhythm , S1 and S2 , no extra heart sounds , abdomen distended with an epigastric mass noted , mildly tender to palpation , no guarding .
Bowel sounds were present .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count was 14.4 , hematocrit was 36.2 , platelet count was 217 , sodium was 135 , potassium was 3.3 , chloride was 99 , bicarbonate was 25 , BUN was 40 , creatinine was 1.9 , glucose was 124 , urinalysis was negative , PT was 12.2 , PTT was 24.5 , calcium was 7.8 , phosphorus was 3.7 , albumin was 2.3 , total bilirubin was 1.3 , alkaline phosphatase was 202 , SGPT was 32 , SGOT was 64 , LDH was 998 , amylase was 150 .
EKG revealed sinus tachycardia at 107 beats per minute .
Evidence of old left anterior septal infarct .
Chest X-ray :
Large left ventricle , bilateral atelectasis or effusion .
Abdominal computerized tomography scan :
Pancreatitis , fluid collection in the lesser sac .
A perisplenic effusion was noted which appeared to communicate with the lesser sac collection .
Gallbladder was visualized with stones .
IN SUMMARY , the patient was considered to have severe necrotizing pancreatitis , with severe cardiac disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted , placed on intravenous fluids .
He was continued on his imipenem , intravenously .
The patient was started on total parenteral nutrition .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/17</PHI>/95 , GI Interventional Radiology performed drainage of the peripancreatic fluid collection .
Approximately one liter of brownish fluid was obtained and sent for culture .
The drainage catheter was left in a pseudocyst .
The patient was evaluated by Cardiology .
A Persantine Thallium study demonstrated a large infarct , involving the posteroseptal , anteroseptal areas .
Left ventricular aneurysm was also noted ; however , no ischemia was seen .
An echocardiogram was done .
The echocardiogram showed terrible left ventricular function , with left ventricular aneurysm .
The right ventricle appeared to be acceptable .
The percutaneous drainage catheter continued to have high output .
The fluid was sent for amylase , which came back 53,230 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 , the patient had new onset of abdominal pain .
His white count had bumped from 8.3 on admission to 18.5 , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI> .
A computerized tomography scan of the abdomen was performed .
Approximately 100 cc.&apos;s of thick brownish material was aspirated through the indwelling catheter .
The computerized tomography scan showed the catheter tip in good position .
Because of the patient &apos;s deteriorating state , the patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/28</PHI>/95 .
An exploratory laparotomy was performed .
The splenic flexure had a purulent exudative process along the antimesenteric surface .
Thus , the splenic flexure and a portion of the descending colon were resected .
The patient underwent a left colectomy with end transverse colostomy , and oversewing of the descending colon .
Drainage of the pancreatic necrosis was also done .
The patient tolerated the procedure fairly well , and was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the Intensive Care Unit , the patient had a prolonged course .
The patient was then extubated on postoperative day #2 , but remained pressor-dependent .
He remained on imipenem , and Vancomycin was also started .
Thereafter , the patient had a long and complicated postoperative course .
He was eventually transferred to the floor , where he remained meta-stable .
He had repeated episodes of hypotension to 80-90 systolic/40-50 diastolic .
These resolved without incident .
He also had repeated temperature spikes .
After repeated work ups , it was felt that these were probably due to remaining infection in the peripancreatic area .
His drainage tube from the peripancreatic area was gradually advanced , and eventually discontinued .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .
Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .
This 28 day course was completed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI>/95 .
The patient was also treated initially with amphotericin-B and then with fluconazole for a computerized tomography guided aspirate of a small fluid collection around his pancreas , which grew Candida albicans .
The patient also had several episodes of fungal cystitis with Torulopsis glabrata , going from his urine .
He was treated with amphotericin-B bladder washes for this .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> was initially anticoagulated for his left ventricular aneurysm .
He remained stable from a cardiac fashion .
He did have problems with po intake .
He had repeated bouts of small-volume emesis that may have been secondary to reflux .
He was treated with a variety of anti-emetics , most recently Granisetron , with only mild success .
He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .
By the end of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> , it became clear that Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Mass</PHI> would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .
The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .
Multiple discussions were held between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mass</PHI> , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient &apos;s wife , with this same result .
After discussion with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Douet</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vassdiysey Medical Center</PHI> .
Of note , given the patient &apos;s do not resuscitate status and the risk for bleeding , the patient &apos;s Coumadin was stopped without incident several weeks before transfer .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
History of multinodular goiter ; history of hypertension ; history of subtotal thyroidectomy .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Electrical cardioversion .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Lenkpruskihkooglekih</PHI> is a 63-year-old lady with a history of frequent premature ventricular contractions and infrequent short runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia ( one four-beat run ) in 1991 , for which several antiarrhythmic agents including Propranolol , Quinidine , Procainamide , Tenormin , Norpace , Corgard , and Flecainide were used , but were stopped because of intolerance .
At that time , she had clear coronary arteries on coronary angiography and an ejection fraction greater than 50% .
She did well off antiarrhythmic agents until <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of this year when she was noted to have atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate after several days of decreased exercise tolerance .
She was started on Coumadin and had a failed attempt at DC electrical cardioversion on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/96 .
She has been on Coumadin since and has continued to have occasional palpitations and mild shortness of breath .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Includes a history of hypertension ; multinodular goiter ; subtotal thyroidectomy .
MEDICATIONS :
Include Cardizem CD 180 mg daily ; Monopril 10 mg daily ; Digoxin .25 mg daily ; and Lasix 40 mg every other day .
ALLERGIES :
To Quinidine , Procardia , and sulfa antibiotics .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination , blood pressure was 200/100 ; heart rate 120 per minute ( atrial fibrillation ) .
The patient was noted to be anxious .
There was no neck vein distension or carotid bruits .
Heart sounds were normal .
The lungs were clear .
The abdominal examination was benign .
There was no peripheral edema .
Pulses were all easily palpable .
LABORATORY DATA :
A 12-lead electrocardiogram showed atrial fibrillation with a QT interval of .46 seconds .
There were diffuse ST segment and T-wave abnormalities , which were nonspecific .
A complete blood count , electrolytes , BUN and creatinine were within normal limits .
INR was elevated at 2.5 .
An echocardiogram was performed , which showed completely normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction calculated at .74 .
There was no evidence of left ventricular hypertrophy or asymmetric septal hypertrophy , which had been an issue that had been raised on an echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ownra Cin , New Mexico</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/06</PHI>/96 .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was started on Propafenone 300 mg three times a day and underwent an attempt at electrical cardioversion after seven doses of this .
This failed , despite one shock at 300 joules and two shocks at 360 joules .
The Propafenone was stopped , and the patient was changed to Amiodarone 400 mg t.i.d. , which was continued for two days .
The patient was discharged to home on Amiodarone 200 mg daily on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/29</PHI>/96 .
An electrocardiogram showed no evidence of QT prolongation prior to discharge , and pulmonary function tests will be performed before the patient goes home today .
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ther Ludzjesc</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Shiekeu Hospital Medical Centers</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</PHI> .

DEATH
SUMMARY PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
DUODENAL PERFORATION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 60 year-old gentleman with a past medical history of gastric lymphoma status post total gastrectomy / splenectomy in 1991 with a Roux-en-Y reconstruction .
The patient noted onset of diffuse abdominal pain , periumbilical and epigastric in nature , nausea and vomiting and back pain starting at 1:00 a.m. on the day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 .
The patient denies fevers , chills or sweats , shortness of breath or chest pain .
He had a normal bowel movement the day prior to admission .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
History of small bowel obstruction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/17</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/15</PHI> , pancytopenia , history of right renal calculus .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Splenectomy , total gastrectomy as above , for gastric lymphoma for which he also received chemotherapy .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Epogen and Vitamin B 12 injections .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
White blood cell count 4.5 , hematocrit 31.9 , creatinine 1.1 .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
Temperature 97.1 , heart rate 65 , blood pressure 101/74 , 100 percent oxygen saturation on room air .
ABDOMEN :
Soft , slightly distended , nontender .
No hernias .
The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .
There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .
There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .
The patient went to the operating room on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .
This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .
There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .
Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .
However by the mid morning of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of March</PHI> , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .
The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .
At this point the patient &apos;s creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .
The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .
The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .
The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/14</PHI>/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .
Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .
However prior to this it was also noted that the patient &apos;s scrotum was necrotic .
An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .
Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .
In the abdomen the patient &apos;s retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .
The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .
Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .
He was hydrated vigorously .
It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .
This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .
The patient &apos;s urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .
therefore the patient went back to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/15</PHI>/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .
Further debridement was undertaken .
The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .
The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .
Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .
The patient &apos;s family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/16</PHI>/00 .
The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI>/00 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 64-year-old woman with accelerating angina pectoris , who had a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> revealing three-vessel disease .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for a cardiac surgical evaluation .
The patient &apos;s cardiac history has been known for several years .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/96 , the patient had a cardiac catheterization that revealed a moderate right coronary artery ostial lesion , severe lesion at the ostial PLV , 50-60% circumflex lesion , 40% proximal left anterior descending , and severe proximal D1 .
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Bitamp Memorial</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/11</PHI>/99 , having had three episodes of chest pain .
Her CKs were found to be elevated with a peak of 1237 with only one increase in MB fractionation .
She had a repeat cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Chimass Community Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI>/99 , which showed three-vessel disease , including right coronary artery 70% ostial , left anterior descending 70% , circumflex 100% .
Her ejection fraction was estimated at 60% .
There was 1 mitral regurgitation .
The patient was transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/99 , where a coronary artery bypass graft x 4 was performed .
The bypasses are listed above .
The bypass time was 2 hours , 19 minutes , cross-clamp time was 1 hour , 36 minutes .
The patient received 3 units of packed red blood cells .
She received 1 unit of normal saline .
Postoperatively , the patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
The patient arrived at the Surgical Intensive Care Unit on dopamine at 150 , epinephrine at .25 , levofloxacin at 7 , Xylocaine at 1.5 , Nitroglycerin at 150 , Fentanyl / Versed drip at 8 .
Her sedation was weaned and she was extubated as per protocol .
Her chest tubes were removed , as per protocol .
The patient was weaned off her pressors and was transferred from the Surgical Intensive Care Unit to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 12 Mini-Unit</PHI> on postoperative day 1 .
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was routine .
Prior to her transfer to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Goman 12 Unit</PHI> , her last cardiac index in the Surgical Intensive Care Unit had been between 2.0 and 2.2 .
2. Renal :
The patient was dialyzed , as stated above , and had fluid taken off in order to approach her preoperative weight .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s weight was approximately 173 pounds with a preoperative weight of 156 pounds .
Her hematocrit was 26.9 .

Discharge Date :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/20</PHI>/1991
HISTORY :
The patient is a seventy-two-year-old male with a history of diffuse atherosclerotic disease who had a coronary artery bypass graft in 1989 followed a failed angioplasty .
Coincident with the angioplasty he received a large contrast load leading to the development of renal failure and hemodialysis .
He also has had bilateral carotid endarterectomy and right aorto-femoral bypass .
The patient had done well until about two weeks prior to admission when he started developing several episodes of chest pain with minimal exertion .
He was admitted when he failed medical therapies for a diagnostic catheterization to evaluate his saphenous grafts and his native coronary circulation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical exam he had a blood pressure of 152/92 , pulse 80 and regular , respirations 18 .
On cardiac exam he had a slightly diffuse point of maximal impulse , normal S1 , split S2 , grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the left sternal border , positive S4 .
The carotids were one plus with bruits bilaterally .
The left femoral is barely perceptible , right femoral two plus with a bruit .
The abdominal aorta was approximately 4 cm .
LABORATORY DATA :
The electrocardiogram on admission was normal sinus rhythm at 80 , normal axis , left atrial enlargement and left ventricular hypertrophy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 17</PHI> , 1991 , the patient had a catheterization that showed an occluded proximal right coronary artery with the PDA filling via left to right collaterals , an occluded left circumflex after the OMB2 , and a very proximal occlusion of the LAD .
With regard to his saphenous grafts , the saphenous vein graft to the LAD was patent , as were the grafts to LADD1 and to the marginal territory .
The patient had recurrent chest pain at rest in the hospital .
Antianginals were increased and including Procardia was increased to 90 q.d.
These changes in his medical regiment seemed to significantly improve his angina .
It was decided that he would be discharged on medical management .
We were very reluctant to recommend further invasive interventions in view of his dissuse atherosclerosis and renal failure , which make him a very high risk candidate for further PTCAs .
During the hospitalization the patient was dialyzed for his renal failure .
On admission his BUN and creatinine were 7.4 and 48 .
He received dialysis without complication .
The patient was anemic .
On presentation he had a hematocrit of 29.5 secondary to renal failure .
He was transfused during the hospitalization .
He was discharged in stable condition on the following medications :
Procardia XL , 90 mg p.o. q.d. ; Lopressor , 50 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; nitroglycerine 1/150 1 tab s.l. p.r.n. pain ; Nitrol patch , 10 mg q.a.m. ; iron sulfate , 325 mg p.o. b.i.d. ; Nephrocaps , 1 tab. p.o. q.d. ; Xanax , 0.5 mg p.o. q.h.s.
He is to have a low cholesterol , low fat renal diet .
Activities as tolerated .
He is to be followed-up by his private doctor .

ATTENDING :
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">SALENE MARGGAY NORFJESCSTOOKS</PHI> MD
ADMISSION DIAGNOSIS :
Hypoglycemia leading to question seizure , non ST-elevation MI , GI bleed , anemia .
CHIEF COMPLAINT :
Question seizure / loss of consciousness with hypoglycemia , fingerstick blood sugar of 24 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
An 82-year-old male with a history of CAD status post CABG , CVA status post CEA , diabetes mellitus , hypertension , GI bleeding , CHF with an EF of 35% , left lower lobe pneumonia on admission on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/22</PHI>/04 - <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/31</PHI>/2004 , PVD and bladder cancer .
The patient recently DC&apos;d to home from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Erdiconre Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/2004 .
The patient reports feeling increasingly weak times several days and on the morning of admission needed assistance to go to the bathroom where he had a melanotic stool .
Of note , the patient has had melena times months with multiple blood transfusions at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Usoak Rinix Hospital</PHI> .
The patient , after having his melanotic stool , had a question seizure-like activity with question loss of consciousness .
EMS was called and found the patient &apos;s fingerstick blood sugar to be 24 .
The patient at that time had slurred speech with altered mental status .
The patient at the site was given 1 amp of D50 .
Fingerstick blood sugar on repeat was 190 .
The patient was transferred to the ED .
Of note , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> ED the patient was noted to have a hematocrit of 23.7 down from low 30s , a troponin of 5.8 , and an EKG with afib showing peak T-waves .
At that time the patient was thought to have non ST elevation MI ; however , family declined aggressive cardiac intervention and opted for medical management only .
Thus , the patient was admitted to the Medical Service for GI workup including possibly EGD .
Of note , the patient had a previously scheduled EGD for <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/17</PHI> .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. Cardiovascular :
Ischemia :
The patient is status post a non ST elevation MI , a troponin peaked at 22 likely secondary to dehydration and presentation of acute renal failure .
The patient was managed on a beta blocker .
Aspirin was held second to his concurrent GI bleed .
Pump :
The patient was initially hydrated on exam ; however , the patient became euvolemic after transfusion of blood and _____ IV fluids .
Of note , the patient was transfused for a total of 4 units of packed red blood cells during this admission .
Lasix was given after each unit of packed red blood cells .
Repeat echo revealed an EF of 45-50% with inferior and posterior basal hypokinesis .
Overall , the patient had preserved LV function despite a large troponin leak .
Rate and rhythm :
The patient with a history of afib .
Afib was stable .
Coumadin and aspirin are held again secondary to his concurrent GI bleed .
2. GI :
A GI consult was obtained and the patient had adequate IV access .
Hematocrit was checked q.8h and the patient was transfused again , as noted above , a total of 4 units packed red blood cells for a hematocrit of less than 30 .
The patient was started on Protonix IV 40 b.i.d.
Per GI consult given the patient &apos;s non ST elevation MI he would be a high risk candidate for a GI endoscopy at this time and therefore in the peri non ST elevation MI period would prefer supportive management at this time with follow up including elective GI workup in 4-6 weeks .
The patient continued to have guaiac positive stools but no evidence of bright red blood per rectum or large amounts of melena .
On the date of discharge the patient has stools that are only trace guaiac positive .
3. Endocrine :
On admission , all oral hyperglycemics were held and the patient was covered with regular insulin sliding scale q.a.c. and q.h.s.
The patient &apos;s fingersticks were in the 150s without any coverage .
The patient was restarted on a low dose glipizide at 2.5 mg and adjustments to be made at the next PCP visit .
4. Heme :
Hematocrit is stable .
Has remained stable above 30 without any need for further transfusions .
Over the last several days the patient received a total of 4 units packed red blood cells during this admission .
On discharge his hematocrit is 35.4 .
5. ID :
The patient was initially started on Levo 250 mg q.d. for a UTI .
However , his urine cultures were positive for MRSA and the patient completed a seven day course of Vancomycin IV .
6. Pulmonary :
The patient with a history of MRSA left lower lobe pneumonia .
We have a low threshold for starting antibiotics ; however , chest x-ray reveals no acute changes and the patient remained 96% on room air throughout this admission without any stigmata over recurrent pneumonia including cough , dyspnea or shortness of breath .
7. Renal :
The patient came in with a creatinine that was elevated at 2.6 .
His baseline was 1.8-2.2 likely pre renal azotemia and subsequently his creatinine improved with hydration and the packed red blood cell transfusions , and his creatinine steadily decreased down to his baseline .
On discharge his creatinine is 1.8 .
CODE STATUS :
Code is DNR / DNI .
TO DO PLAN :
1. The patient is to follow up with PCP , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Toob Obestimeuph</PHI> in two weeks .
2. The patient is to follow up with the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> GI Service in four weeks .
3. The patient is deconditioned secondary to his week long hospital stay and long rehabilitation stay and will require aggressive physical therapy .
4. The patient should have q.o.d. hematocrit checks to ensure that his hematocrit is above 30 and if it is below 30 should be transfused secondary to his underlying known CAD .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Include Albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg nebs q.4h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Vitamin D 5000 units p.o. q.weekly , iron sulfate 325 mg p.o. t.i.d. , folate 1 mg p.o. q.d. , regular insulin sliding scale , Lopressor 25 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Neutrophos 250 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Senna 2 tablets p.o. b.i.d. , multivitamins with minerals one tab p.o. q.d. , trazadone 50 mg p.o. q.h.s. p.r.n. insomnia , Zocor 40 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Atrovent nebulizers 0.5 mg nebs q.i.d. p.r.n. shortness of breath , Pulmicort two puffs inhaled b.i.d. and Nexium 40 mg p.o. b.i.d.

Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of l.0l5 , a pH of 8.0 , l+ ketones , and no blood .
Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .
EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .
No old EKG was available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .
Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .
Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .
Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .
SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .
The patient underwent <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital</PHI> multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .
She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .
This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .
She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .
2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .
She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .
Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .
Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .
Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .
This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .
Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .
A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .
She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .
Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , the <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , and the <PHI TYPE="DATE">Septemberth of 2006</PHI> to assure that her hematocrit recovers .
3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/15</PHI>/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.
Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .
Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .
Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatitis B-related cirrhosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Tuberculosis in childhood .
(2) Hepatic encephalopathy .
(3) Grade I esophageal varices .
(4) Hepatic hydrothorax on the right .
(5) peptic ulcer disease .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Repeated pleurocentesis .
Chest tube placement on the right .
Endotracheal intubation .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .
The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .
He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .
It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .
The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of February</PHI> , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .
The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .
This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">17th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .
He has not been considered as a candidate for a TIPPS or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant list for his blood type , B .
Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Hibbslires</PHI> was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .
His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .
Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .
During the first week of <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .
He became dependent on pressers .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th of February</PHI> , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .
In consultation with the patient &apos;s primary doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc</PHI> and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Loydbreunlinke</PHI> , and with the patient &apos;s family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .
The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family &apos;s wishes , was not begun with this patient .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .
The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th of February</PHI> , 1997 .
The family was present .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leynslentnerswaimjesc , Lau</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Launtburce</PHI> were notified .

There was mild flattening in V5 and V6 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Problem #1 was cardiac .
The patient ruled out for myocardial infarction by enzymes and electrocardiogram .
He had multiple episodes during hospitalization of chest pain radiating to the back , during which his vital signs remained stable and there were no electrocardiogram changes .
His pain resolved with nitroglycerin sublingually and occasional MSO4 intravenously .
An exercise tolerance test was performed and the patient went 7 minutes 6 seconds and was terminated secondary to fatigue .

7) THROMBOCYTOPENIA STATUS POST BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT .
8) MULTIPLE MYELOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 59-year-old white male .
The patient has had multiple myeloma since 1990 .
He underwent an autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
At that time he received total body irradiation of 1400 cGy .
This bone marrow transplant did not produce remission and then he was treated with three cycles of VAD subsequently .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 , the patient developed lower back pain .
A workup done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">DE</PHI> is not available at the time of this dictation .
According to her scanty records , an MRI of the spine showed diffuse spinal column involvement with lesions in T4 and T8 with no cord compression at that time .
He was then treated with radiation therapy from T3 to T9 receiving 2500 cGy from <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/94 .
He has been on Decadron since <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/94 .
About two weeks prior to admission the patient developed mid back pain , burning in nature with radiation around the right lower ribs .
He also began to develop noticeably increasing bilateral lower extremity weakness and possibly numbness in the lower extremities .
He stated that he had difficulty rising from a chair .
An MRI without gadolinium done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/20</PHI>/94 of the spine showed a right posterior lateral epidural mass extending from T9 to T12 .
There was evidence of cord compression .
The patient &apos;s Decadron dose was increased to 12 mg q day and he was also started on MS Contin and radiation therapy was being planned and arranged at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Petersly Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
However , one day prior to admission the patient developed right lower extremity pain and could not walk secondary to the pain .
Over the next 12 hours while in transit to the hospital , the patient &apos;s right lower extremity became red , swollen , and increasingly painful .
He has had chronic bilateral lower extremity swelling since his transplant but the right lower extremity swelling was noticeably increased .
He also complained of some fecal incontinence the day prior to admission without urinary incontinence .
At the time of presentation the patient denied headache , arm weakness , changes in vision , dysarthria , abdominal pain , nausea or vomiting , chest pain or shortness of breath .
He was taken to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Huyychestleme Health Of</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Scoo , Utah</PHI> where he had a temperature of 99.9 , blood pressure 90/50 , heart rate 128 , and O2 sat of 91% on room air .
Blood cultures , urine culture , and UA were all done .
Blood cultures drawn on admission subsequently grew Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
He was treated with Ceftazidime , gentamicin , and Vancomycin and also was started on a Dopamine drip for treatment of his sepsis .
A Swan was placed and initial readings were CVP of 6 , wedge pressure of 10 to 12 , cardiac index of 4.7 , and SVR of 438 all consistent with a Pseudomonas sepsis picture .
He was given stress steroids and was subsequently transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lorough Medical Center</PHI> &apos;s Intensive Care Unit for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Multiple myeloma .
2) Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
3) Plasmacytoma of T9 through T12 .

6) Failed autologous bone marrow transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>/92 .
7) Hypothyroidism .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Positive for diabetes mellitus .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Married to a very supportive wife .
ALLERGIES :
Question of penicillin and sulfa drugs leading to a rash .
MEDICATIONS :
On transfer include Vancomycin , Ceftazidime , gentamicin , Solu Cortef 100 mg q8h , Lasix , Synthroid , insulin , MS Contin 60 mg b.i.d. , MSO4 2 mg p.r.n. pain IV , Dopamine 12 mcg per minute .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission showed a non-toxic appearing male with temperature 99.5 , blood pressure 82/50 , heart rate 118 , respiratory rate 15 .
HEENT exam atraumatic , no oral lesions .
Neck supple , carotids without bruits .
Cardiac exam was regular S1 and S2 , no murmur .
Chest clear to auscultation with a few fine crackles at the left base .
Abdomen non-distended , positive bowel sounds , soft , non-tender , no hepatosplenomegaly or masses .
Rectal normal tone , guaiac positive brown stool , no perirectal lesions or erythema .
Extremities reveal the right lower extremity was tense , purple-red , swollen , and was warm from the knee to the ankle and extremely tender .
There was pitting edema of both lower extremities but no evidence of cellulitis of the left lower extremity .
Neurological exam on admission revealed he was drowsy but easily arousable to voice , oriented to person , <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , and date , able to say no but mildly inattentive during examination .
Cranial nerves intact .
Motor exam normal tone , positive asterixis , no drift .
Strength was decreased in both lower extremities .
Coordination was normal with good finger to nose , gait was not tested .
Deep tendon reflexes were 2+ in the upper extremities , 1+ in the patella reflexes , no reflexes at the ankles , upgoing Babinski toes bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed white blood cell count 4.2 , Hct 27 , platelet count 28 .
Glucose 191 .
PT 17.6 , PTT 48.7 , fibrinogen 686 , TT 39.2 .
Magnesium 1.7 .
UA showed no white blood cells , positive granular casts .
Chest x-ray was without infiltrates , wand in good position .
An MRI was performed upon admission and showed an epidural mass at the right posterior lateral T9 to T12 area invading the neural foramina .
There was no CSF density .
These findings were consistent with the cord compression .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
By problems -
1) INFECTIOUS DISEASE / CELLULITIS :
The patient &apos;s clinical situation was most consistent with a Pseudomonas cellulitis and subsequent sepsis .
Blood cultures drawn at the outside hospital grew out Pseudomonas that was sensitive to Imipenem and Tobramycin .
There were cultures obtained seeping from the wound at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and those also grew out Pseudomonas aeruginosa .
The organism grown at this institution was sensitive to Imipenem , Ceftazidime , Amikacin , gentamicin , Ciprofloxacin , Tobramycin but was resistant to Cefotetan , Ceftriaxone , Mezlocillin , Bactrim , Ampicillin , chloramphenicol , and sulbactam .
He was treated initially with Ceftazidime and gentamicin but there was a question about the organism &apos;s susceptibility from lab studies done at the outside hospital .
He was subsequently switched to Imipenem and Tobramycin and was maintained on those medications throughout the hospital course .
The Tobramycin and Imipenem were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/25</PHI>/94 .
In addition , the patient received a five day course of intravenous IgG to improve infection control .
Vancomycin was also added to his regimen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28</PHI>/94 and this was primarily to provide improved MRSA coverage as he continued to have erythema along the lateral right lower extremity .
He was evaluated by the Surgery Department and it is there feeling that there is no indication for surgical intervention / amputation at this time .
He is being maintained with twice daily Xeroform with Betadine changes .
These dressing changes are applied by applying the Xeroform on Betadine initially and then changing it with sterile dry bandages .
Of note , the patient has extreme pain with these dressing changes and requires parenteral morphine sulfate for pain control during dressing changes .
The plan is to complete a full course of Imipenem and Tobramycin for his Pseudomonas cellulitis .
As mentioned earlier he continues to have erythema tracking up his leg and up to his lateral thigh .
The cause of this erythema is not know at this time but has not shown extensive progression .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
The patient was initially treated with Dopamine which was subsequently weaned off after his sepsis improved .
He was noted to be in rapid AF on several episodes receiving 5 mg IV Lopressor each time with improvement .
He has been in and out of atrial fibrillation and normal sinus rhythm .
An echocardiogram performed at the outside hospital while he was septic showed decreased global EF .
The patient is being maintained on Digoxin for his paroxysmal atrial fibrillation .
He has had no significant episode of tachycardia or blood pressure alteration during the final days of hospitalization .
The plan is to continue the Digoxin and to recheck an echocardiogram to assess his ejection fraction when he is clinically better .
3) ONCOLOGY :
The patient has a plasmacytoma affecting the spine .
He has been receiving radiation therapy to that area during the hospital stay .
The plan is to complete a full course of XRT to the spinal region for the plasmacytoma .
The patient &apos;s lesion compressing his thoracic spine was never biopsied , however , the MRI appearance does not seem to be infectious and is most consistent with plasmacytoma for which he is receiving the radiation therapy .
4) NEUROLOGIC :
As mentioned above he has a cord compression and is on steroids .
He was initially treated with IV Decadron 10 mg up front and then 6 mg q6h.
His neurological exam remained stable with no evidence of increasing lower extremity edema .
His Decadron dose was titrated down to 5 mg IV q6h on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/3</PHI>/94 .
His Decadron dose will be slowly titrated down over time following his neurological exam closely .
5) BLOOD SUGARS :
The patient has steroid induced diabetes mellitus .
He has been on increasing doses of insulin receiving NPH in the morning and night in addition to a CZI sliding scale on a q6h basis .
The plan is to continue the supplemental insulin while he is on steroids and while his sugars remain high .
6) RESPIRATORY :
He initially required a face mask to keep his saturation above 90% .
However , with increasing diuresis and improving septic pictures his O2 saturations have improved and he is now on nasal cannula and will be maintained on nasal cannula to keep his sat above 93% .
He can be given intravenous Lasix as needed for any evidence of respiratory compromise or increasing pulmonary edema .
7) NUTRITION :
The patient has a poor nutritional status with hypoalbuminemia .
He has been maintained on tube feeds and that should be continued .
He should also be encouraged to eat as much as possible orally in addition to this tube feeds and aspiration precaution should be maintained .
8) ELEVATED PT and PTT :
Both of these responded to three day course of vitamin K 10 mg each day .
His PT and PTT are now normal , however , he continues to run a low platelet count .
This has been evident since the time of his bone marrow transplant .
We have been transfusing him with platelets to keep his counts above 20,000 to reduce his bleeding risk .
He also received several blood transfusions while here to maintain his Hct around 30 .
Thrombocytopenic inducing drugs should be avoided if possible on this patient .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">08/19</PHI>/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Acute myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
urinary tract infection , congestive heart failure , Parkinson &apos;s disease , chronic subarachnoid hemorrhage , history prostate cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient presented to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> with a fever .
The patient is a 79-year-old male with a history of Parkinson &apos;s disease x &apos;s 18 years , prostate cancer , urinary incontinence and recent subdurals after fall .
He reports lower abdominal pain x&apos;s 2 days .
Of note , he is a very poor historian given his difficulty speaking and inability to write from his Parkinson &apos;s disease .
His wife noted him to be restless on the day of admission , felt warm , temperature to 102.5 .
They went to a local hospital where he was found to have a temperature of 102.4 and blood cultures were done and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for admission .
He was recently started on a Texas catheter for urinary incontinence at home .
He has no symptoms of shortness of breath , cough , diarrhea , nausea , vomiting , choking on food , no new medications .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS ; On admission were Eldepryl , Artane , Prilodol , Sinemet and Opuputine .
ALLERGIES :
He had no known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted and started on Ampingent intravenously .
There was a question of aspiration pneumonia so he was switched from Ampicillin pen-g to aspiration pneumonia .
He was continued on his Parkinson &apos;s medications .
A head CT was scheduled to rule out interval increase in subdurals .
Head CT results show full bilateral acute hemorrhage in his subdural hematomas , now with slight midline shift .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Factor</PHI> agreed he would review the CTs and follow the patient while in house .
He was seen by urology , who suggested to leave the catheter in for now in the setting of doubt ms .
He was seen by neuro , who felt that the subdural hemorrhages should be followed and treated conservatively as well as precautions for fall and no further intervention was warranted given risk of re-bleed which is quite high with his atrophic changes .
The patient &apos;s mental status improved greatly after the onset of intravenous antibiotics , doing much better , was much more awake and alert and the plan was to possibly send him home on po antibiotics and full <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Arnsperni Health</PHI> services .
Bedside swallow test was done which showed him to have some aspiration .
He did have some recurrent fevers and his intravenous antibiotic were continued .
Thus , he was considered ready for discharge .
He again became much more somnolent , there was a question whether he had re-aspirated .
He again was becoming increasing febrile and somnolent while the patient was awaiting a chest x-ray and further evaluation .
He was switched over the Clinda and Gentamicin for his aspiration pneumonia and again his mental status improved .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/10</PHI>/97 , the patient became unresponsive and apneic .
Brachial consult was obtained and the patient was intubated and transferred to the Intensive Care Unit .
He was found to be profoundly hypoxic with sats down to 60% on 100% facemask .
He was hypotensive into the 80s .
An electrocardiogram showed evolving inferior q wave with increased ST segment and left anterior ST depressions .
RV leads were negative for ST elevation .
A chest x-ray showed marked congestive heart failure with increased heart size .
A portable echo showed no pericardial effusion and his left ventricle was severely diffusely hypokinetic with septal dyskinesis .
Anterior and inferior akinesis , apical akinesis to the posterior lateral wall moved slightly .
He had about 20% mild mitral regurgitation .
The right ventricle was markedly dilated with a kinetic free wall and very decreased function in a marked incomplete closure of the tricuspid valve with wide open tricuspid regurgitation .
He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit for his acute myocardial infarction with very likely multi-vessel disease with concominent left anterior descending severe stenosis or likely left anterior descending with collateral circulation from that occluded right coronary artery .
The patient was also evaluated by neurosurgery , given the difficult situation , the patient was not a candidate for streptokinase or tpa given his chronic subdurals with a recent new bleed .
He was evaluated by neurosurgery , who felt that if heparin could be avoided , that would be best .
He was treated conservatively with intubation , control of heart rate and on Dobutamine for pressure support .
He was diuresed with Lasix and Diuril and was oxygenating fairly well while intubated .
He surprisingly made it through the next 24 hours .
He was dynamically stable on his Dobutamine with improved oxygenation .
The patient continued fairly stable while intubated .
Two days after the myocardial infarction he continued with stable blood pressure on a very small amount of Dobutamine .
He had diuresed very well with good oxygenation .
His neurostatus was indeterminate given his sedation on the ventilatory .
Discussions with the family were ongoing regarding do not resuscitate and long term plan given his comorbidities .
They were waiting appropriately for some information from the repeat echo after his myocardial infarction .
An echo showed that there was not much improvement in cardiac function , both right or left ventriculus .
They did at that time decide to make him do not resuscitate , but were interested in continuing supportive care to see how much he would bounce back .
The repeat echo showed no improvement in left ventricle or right ventricle function with marked akinesis of many walls .
The lack of meaningful recovery was much less likely .
Discussions were had with the family regarding withdrawal of ventilator support , which they very appropriately decided on given the low possibility of any meaningful recovery .
He was extubated successfully and was breathing comfortably on his own .
The patient was transferred back to the medical floor in stable , but very guarded condition .
No further blood draws were done .
The patient was made comfortable on a low dose of intravenous Morphine with sectioning to prevent further aspiration .
Comfort measures continued until the day <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 , where Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Koteleebdils</PHI> was found to be pulseless , without respirations .
He was declared dead at 7:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/19</PHI>/97 .
The family and the attending physician were notified .

This took place in 1983 .
In 1992 he underwent redo surgery and aortic valve replacement .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> 1994 he presented with an acute inferior myocardial infarction and was given Streptokinase .
He had recurrent pain and went to the Catheter Laboratory where a proximal right coronary artery lesion was angioplastied .
A relook several days later led to a repeat percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty .
He has has stable , mild angina , subsequently , mostly in the setting of stress .
Slightly increased in recent months .
On the day of admission , he was involved in a minor motor vehicle accident , and there was some apparent controversy with the driver of the other vehicle , during the course of which he developed substernal chest pain radiating to the left arm and shoulder .
This waxed and waned for thirty to sixty minutes , and he took a number of nitroglycerins .
After returning home after conferring with his wife , and the pain lasted another half hour , he came to the emergency room .
His electrocardiogram showed increased T wave inversions in V3 and V4 and 1 mm .
ST segment depression in V3 through V6 .
His examination was largely benign after he was made pain free .
The pulse was 75 , blood pressure 120/80 , respirations 18 , and he was afebrile .
The jugular veins were not distended , the carotid volume was diminished .
The chest was clear and the cardiac rhythm was regular .
There were normal prothetic valves .
There was a grade II-II apical and systolic murmur .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is a 75 year old woman who is status post sigmoid resection for Duke &apos;s C2 low sigmoid carcinoma admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with abdominal pain and neutropenia .
She first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1990 with abdominal pain and ultimately was diagnosed with a Duke &apos;s B2 tumor in her transverse colon and had a transverse colectomy with reanastomosis .
She then represented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 1996 with rectal bleeding and was found to have a tumor 15 cm from the anal verge in the distal sigmoid colon .
She underwent a sigmoid resection on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI>/96 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
At the time of surgery there was no evidence of liver disease .
Pathology showed moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma invading through the muscularis puerperia .
One of ten lymph nodes was positive for tumor .
She was therefore staged Dukes C2 .
An abdominal CT scan obtained prior to surgery showed only sigmoid thickening and two noticeable lymph nodes in the region of the sigmoid .
A chest x-ray was read as clear .
She is not to have any tumor markers sent before surgery .
She presented to the Hematology / Oncology Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/5</PHI>/96 for evaluation of possible adjuvant chemotherapy .
She began adjuvant chemotherapy coupled with pelvic radiation .
She was receiving daily radiation treatments under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aacent Slentjae</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linatpromehack Worth Hospital</PHI> for Radiation Therapy .
She began treatment on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/20</PHI>/96 .
She subsequently had three days of IV bolus 5-FU chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 25th</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">27th</PHI> of 1996 , which she tolerated well .
Her course was then complicated by the onset of severe back pain at the beginning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> .
She had unremarkable lumbosacral films , except for degenerative joint disease .
An MRI was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/25</PHI>/96 to rule out cord compression and showed no evidence of cord compression .
However , they were unable to rule out a soft tissue abnormality at L5 encroaching on a neural foramen .
She presented to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/8</PHI>/96 with complaints of several days of lower abdominal pain , nausea , anorexia and low grade temperatures .
She denied diarrhea or vomiting , but did have constipation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
(1) Colon carcinoma with transverse colectomy in 1992.
(2) Coronary artery disease , status post myocardial infarction with TPA thrombolysis .
Cardiac catheterization showed sequential LAD and she underwent angioplasty twice to the LAD with good results .
An echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> of 1994 showed an ejection fraction of 40-45% .
Her baseline electrocardiogram showed a left bundle branch block .
(3) Noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
(4) Osteoporosis .
(5) Hypercholesterolemia .
(6) History of herpes zoster .
(7) Status post appendectomy .
(8) Status post total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Surgical Service under the care of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lenni Pain</PHI> .
Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .
A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .
An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .
However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .
This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .
These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .
She was admitted and made NPO .
On admission , her white count was 15,000 with an absolute neutrophil count of 1,000 .
She was initially afebrile and hemodynamically stable .
Her ANC dropped to about 200 over the next 48 hours and she developed guaiac positive diarrhea .
She was begun on IV antibiotics on admission of mezlocillin , gentamicin and metronidazole .
She was also placed on neutropenic precautions .
She continued to spike fevers and had episodes of peritoneal signs .
However , repeated abdominal x-rays and CT scans continued to show no signs of obstruction or perforation .
However , she did show persistent inflammation of her small bowel consistent with radiation enteritis .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/96 she was no longer neutropenic but continued to spike low grade fevers .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/18</PHI>/96 she had become afebrile and antibiotics were discontinued .
She was continued on bowel rest and four days prior to discharge she became entirely pain free in her abdomen and was started on TPN .
Of note , a PICC line was placed for facilitating the administration of TPN .
Of note , shortly after starting on her TPN her phosphate level dropped to 1.8 and TPN was temporarily held due to concerns she may be suffering from receding syndrome .
She was supplemented with Neutra-Phos and her TPN was restarted 18 hours later .
DISCHARGE PLAN :
We recommend that she continue to rest her bowel for another seven days .
During this time she will continue to receive TPN .
After that period of time she should slowly start p.o. intake again starting with clear liquids and in particular avoiding fats and lactose .
Her small bowel is likely to be intolerant to lactose for the near future .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Insulin sliding scale b.i.d. , lisinopril 10 mg p.o. q. day , Neutra-phos 500 mg p.o. q. day , metopromide 10 mg p.o. q.6h. p.r.n. nausea , nitroglycerin 1/150 tablets one sublingually q. 5 minutes x three p.r.n. chest pain , nizatidine 150 mg p.o. b.i.d. , Ativan 1 mg p.o. q.4h. p.r.n. nausea , nafcillin dose 4 mg in 24 hours , and TPN .
Make sure her TPN at this point is 6% amino acids and 15% dextrose and 400 kilo calories of lipids , total volume is 1.6 liters and it is to be administered over 20 hours .
In addition to the above , she has the following additives :
20 mm/liter of potassium phosphate , 30.8 mEq per liter of potassium chloride , 30 mEq per liter of sodium chloride , 8 mEq per liter of magnesium sulfate , 94 ng per liter of calcium , 10 ml per day of multivitamins , 10 mg of vitamin K every Monday , 1 ml per day of trace elements , and 22 units of Regular insulin .
Therefore , her total potassium is 60 mEq per liter , total sodium is 30 , and total phosphate is 20 .
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Rule</PHI> is to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Chelkjescchalsere</PHI> , who can be reached at <PHI TYPE="PHONE">148-701-5440</PHI> .

2. Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The patient is an 87-year-old male with stage D prostate was cancer , was admitted for fluid hydration on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">10th of March</PHI> .
The patient was initially diagnosed with prostate cancer in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1989 .
He presented with gross hematuria at that time .
Subsequent prostatic biopsy revealed a Gleason &apos;s IV , plus V tumor and the CT showed an irregular large prostate with tumor invasion into the bladder and evidence of bilateral retroperitoneal lymph node spread .
There was also evidence of bone metastasis at that time .
The patient was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1991 for urinary retention and acute renal failure and was treated with fluid rehydration and Foley catheter placement .
Over the past one month prior to admission , the patient &apos;s wife has noticed a marked decrease in p.o. intake and also noted a weight loss of approximately ten pounds in the preceding two weeks .
The patient has been lethargic and bed ridden for the past two weeks , although there was no evidence of fever or chills over this time .
The patient is now admitted for fluid rehydration therapy and observation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
MEDICATIONS :
None currently .
ALLERGIES :
None .
HABITS :
No history of cigarette smoking .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient is afebrile with a recumbent blood pressure of 128/16 , pulse of 76 , and standing blood pressure of 110/60 with a pulse of 88 .
Respirations are unlabored at 16 .
HEENT :
Noted for nonicteric sclerae and lungs that are clear to auscultation .
No CVA tenderness was appreciated in the heart and the heart appears to be in regular rate and rhythm .
EXTREMITIES :
Without cyanosis or edema .
ABDOMEN :
Soft and nontender .
SKIN :
Decreased turgor with dry mucous membranes .
LABORATORY DATA :
White count of 7.75 , hematocrit of 46.2% , sodium 144 , potassium 3.9 , creatinine 25 , and BUN was 1.4 with a blood sugar of 88 .
Urinalysis demonstrated 30-50 white blood cells with red blood cells too numerous to count and 2+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of prostate CA , for fluid rehydration .
Initially , the patient was begun on Bactrim for presumptive urinary tract infection and the initial course of his hospitalization , he took p.o.&apos; s poorly .
The patient remained afebrile , however , and his electrolytes were within normal limits .
By hospital day number six , however , the patient became febrile to 100.7 and repeat urinalysis showed 20-30 white blood cells and 1+ bacteria .
Antibiotics were switched to IV Ciprofloxacin and the patient defervesced ; however , by hospital day number seven , the patient was found to be passing very little urine through his condom catheter and electrolyte screen and electrolytes from hospital day number seven showed a BUN of 27 and a creatinine of 2.7 .
The patient was vigorously fluid rehydrated ; however , by hospital day number nine , BUN was 22 , creatinine was 3.5 .
A Foley catheter was placed at that time with the recovery of approximately 800 cc of urine .
Subsequently , the patient began vigorously diuresing with 4 liters urine recovered the following hospital day .
Blood electrolytes were remarkable for a sodium of 148 and a potassium of 5.1 .
The patient &apos;s fluid hydration from D5 one-half normal saline with 20 mEq of K to D5W and acuchecks from this time showed blood sugars routinely between 20 and 50 .
The patient was given one Amp of D50 for each acucheck for blood sugars of less than 40 .
Gradually over the course of the following days , the patient &apos;s electrolytes again normalized ; however , as the patient continues to take p.o.&apos; s poorly , the patient remained on IV hydration therapy .
On hospital day number fourteen , electrolytes were sodium of 140 , potassium 3.9 , BUN of 11 , creatinine 1.3 with a blood sugar of 125 and a magnesium of 1.9 .
The patient was taking 470 cc of liquid p.o. and is now in stable condition and ready for transfer to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">El Hospital</PHI> to continue his recovery .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">El Hospital</PHI> , still receiving IV hydration at a rate currently of 50 cc an hour of D5 one-half normal with 20 mEq of K .
Should the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop to below 500 , the patient should be hydrated at 75 cc/hour .
If the patient &apos;s p.o. intake drop below 300 cc per day , the patient should be hydrated at 100 cc an hour .
The Foley catheter was in place and the Bacitracin ointment should be applied to the urethral meatus twice a day .
Periodic urinalysis should be conducted to monitor the development of possible urinary tract infection .
It should be noted that while in the hospital , the patient received an abdominal ultrasound which is significant for a grossly enlarged liver with multiple foci of cancer .
The patient is discharged on Mylanta 30 cc with meals , Carafate 1 gm q. 6 , Heparin 5000 units subcutaneous b.i.d. until the patient regains full activity and IV hydration .
The Foley should be in place until a follow-up appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aarhalt</PHI> can be scheduled in approximately one to two weeks at which time a decision regarding the status of the patient &apos;s urinary obstruction will be addressed .

Vital signs :
Heart rate 60 , respiratory rate 18 , blood pressure 116/80 , temperature 97.1 degrees , oxygen saturation 93% on room air .
Head and neck examination was benign .
Skin examination was notable for a leg ulcer and cellulitis to be delineated below .
There were no spider angiomata .
Neck was supple with no thyromegaly .
Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
The heart examination revealed that the patient had a sustained PMI which was located in the left mid clavicular line , S1 , near complete obliteration of the second heart sound by a two out of six high pitched murmur peaking at mid to late systole and heard across the precordium .
It radiates to both carotids bilaterally .

The patient &apos;s admission chest x-ray revealed no infiltrate , no congestive heart failure .
Head CT scan performed in the emergency department revealed no bleed .
Urinalysis revealed trace microscopic hematuria with 47 red blood cells per high powered field , 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1) Mental status changes :
On admission to the emergency room , the patient was somewhat argumentative and confused as well as uncooperative with procedures .
A neurologic work-up was undertaken which included a CT scan of the head which revealed no acute bleed and a lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 72 , protein 65 , white blood cell count 19 , red blood cell count 11,500 with no evidence of xanthrochromasia .
The Neurology Service evaluated the patient who felt that her agitation was most likely due to infection , her multiple medications , or her metabolic condition .
The patient &apos;s mental status slowly began to recover , however on the morning of the first day of admission , <PHI TYPE="DATE">August 16</PHI> , 1998 , the patient was found after having fallen .
A neurological examination was performed which revealed no abnormality and imaging included a head scan which revealed no bleed and a cervical spine series which revealed degenerative joint disease but no obvious fracture .
The patient decided not to pursue further testing with a neck CT scan .
At the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s mental status is back to its baseline .
2) Right lower extremity cellulitis :
The patient was evaluated by the Surgical Service who felt that the wound was clean with some erythema but without evidence of true cellulitis .

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">9-21</PHI>-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
end stage renal disease secondary to hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. diverticulitis ,
2. perforated cecum ,
3. acute renal insufficiency .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
A heterotopic kidney transplant , placed in the left pelvic fossa and native left nephrectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-94 .

4. renal biopsy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-13</PHI>-94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 59 year old male with end stage renal disease from hypertensive nephrosclerosis .
He started on dialysis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/92 and has been maintained on it since .
He is currently on eight times per week hemodialysis .
The patient is admitted for renal transplantation .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
The patient is status post left arteriovenous fistula creation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. hypertension ,
2. difficulty hearing ,
3. gout ,
4. history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , two prior episodes .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Nephrocaps , 1 q.day , Colace 1 q.day , Allopurinol 100 q.day , Verapamil 240 mg q.day , Niferex 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Colchicine 0.6 mg PO q.day , Phoslo 667 mg q.day , Cardura 1 mg PO q.day .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
The review of systems was negative .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was unremarkable .
Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI>-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the <PHI TYPE="ID">EXWAGH9T</PHI> protocol .
His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .
He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .
During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .
Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .
An X-ray at the time revealed free air .
The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .
He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .
He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .
The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .
The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .
A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .
It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .
With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .
At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .
It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .
Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .
He ruled out for myocardial infarction .
An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .
A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .
The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .
Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .
He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone 20 mg PO q.day , Imuran 25 mg PO q.day , Acyclovir 200 mg PO t.i.d. , Bactrim one single strength PO qhs , Maalox 15 cc PO b.i.d. , Zantac 150 mg PO b.i.d. , Verapamil 80 mg PO t.i.d. , Lasix 40 mg PO b.i.d. , Cardura 4 mg PO b.i.d. , Cyclosporin 300 mg PO b.i.d. , Digoxin 0.125 mg PO q.day , Clotrimazole 10 mg PO b.i.d. , Inderal 10 mg PO t.i.d.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 25 year old who has a history of a gunshot wound many years ago and has had multiple surgical procedures since then .
Most recently he was admitted to an outside hospital with a drug overdose in adult respiratory distress syndrome and ultimately found to have Candidal pericarditis which eventually led to constrictive pericarditis .
He had a pericardial window .
He had a barium swallow and endoscopy and was said not to have gastric or pericardial ulcer .
He had previous substernal gastric bypass because of an interruption of his esophagus at the time of his gunshot wound .
He had been noted to have an ulcer and ultimately when he stabilized it was our feeling that he most likely had a gastric pericardial ulcer and he was transferred here for further management .
We discussed the risks with his family .
It was a very high risk in very poor condition and a cachectic malnourished edematous individuals who have very high venous pressures and shortness of breath .
The family understood that this was a life saving procedure and only carried with it approximately 50% chance of success .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
esophagoscopy , bronchoscopy , pericardectomy , excision of gastric ulcer , repair of gastric ulcer and pectoralis major myocutaneous flap performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 4</PHI> , 1995 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Reg Cranka</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Win Shufffyfe</PHI> .
In lieu of a standard discharge summary given this patient &apos;s complicated hospital course and associated illnesses I feel it best to just provide a system summary concerning this patient &apos;s current status .
1. Neurologic and Psychologic :
The patient is on Nortriptyline for depression .
He is a paraplegic from T4 down .
Otherwise he is awake , alert and appropriate and can respond to questions and can move his upper extremities .
The patient however spends most of his time at bedrest due to decubiti ulcer disease .
2. Cardiac :
The patient had constrictive pericarditis that was relieved by his surgical procedure .
He had a cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 1</PHI> , 1995 that showed no complications , elevated right atrial pressure and moderate pulmonary hypertension .
The cardiac output was five liters per minute with an index at 2.9 liters per minute per meter 2 which is normal .
A full copy of the cardiac catheterization report is enclosed with his transfer materials .
The patient also underwent cardiac ultrasound on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 11</PHI> , 1995 that showed abnormal right ventricle wall motion , trace mitral regurgitation , normal left ventricular size and function with an estimated ejection fraction of 64% .
There is Doppler evidence of tricuspid insufficiency and right atrial dilatation .
There is trace pulmonary insufficiency .
The right ventricle is dilated and diffusely hypokinetic and there is no evidence of constrictive physiology which was seen on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 6</PHI> , 1995 .
A copy of this ultrasound is also found in his records .
The patient is on no specific medications for his cardiac condition .
3. Respiratory :
the patient is status post thoracotomy and has staples and sutures on his chest .
These may be removed when the incisions are noted to be well healed .
The patient is approximately three weeks following his procedure and several of these stitches will be removed prior to discharge .
The patient is on oxygen by face mask and his saturations have been remaining normal .
His medications for his respiratory system are Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
3. GI :
The patient has had gastric ulcer repair and also has a colostomy .
The patient has a sinus tract that was studied with a fistulogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 25</PHI> , 1995 .
This showed no communication with the intestines and was simply a sinus tract .
There is no fistula seen .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Asha Vengloan</PHI> of General Surgery consulted on the patient and concluded the patient does not require any surgical treatment of this problem at the current time and the best treatment for this situation would be to increase the patient &apos;s nutrition .
The patient takes poorly his po. diet .
However he is able to swallow and tolerate po&apos;s .
He just claims to have no appetite and has very poor effort with feeding .
The patient is able to tolerate po. medicines .
4. GU :
The patient has an ulcer on his penis that has been treated with dressing changes .
It has been noted to be improving .
The patient has a Foley catheter in and when the penile skin is very well healed his Foley catheter may be removed .
Until this time he should be kept on three times daily wet to dry dressing changes .
5. Skin :
The patient has multiple decubiti over his body , in particular his perineum and buttocks have large decubiti .
Plastic Surgery was consulted Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ca Shuff</PHI> who saw the patient and decided that the patient is not a surgical candidate at this point .
These wounds should be treated with three times daily wet to dry dressings .
The patient &apos;s activity should be limited to being up in a chair only for several minutes per day and sit on a special pad that the family has purchased .
6. Infectious Disease :
The patient &apos;s white count at the time of discharge is within normal limits .
The patient remains on Fluconazole .
His other antibiotics were discontinued .
His most recent cultures are negative .

He has been placed on Oxycodone 10 mg. po. q3hours as needed for pain .
The patient had a PCA and several other medications have been discontinued .
The patient has strong narcotic seeking behavior .
The patient for sleep was given Benadryl 25 to 50 mg. qhs. and was not allowed any increases in his narcotics after weaning him down to just requiring the Oxycodone .
A complete summary of the patient &apos;s medications are as follows :
Cimetidine 300 mg. intravenous q6hours .
Albuterol nebulizer 0.5 mg. 2.5 cc. q4hours .
Senokot two tablets po. bid or Metamucil one tablespoon po. bid .

SEPSIS .
TIME OF DEATH :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 at 3:15 a.m.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> is a 59-year-old gentleman with severe cardiomyopathy , aortic stenosis , alcoholic cirrhosis , and rectal cancer , who was scheduled for a resection of his rectal adenocarcinoma but was found to be in severe congestive heart failure and admitted to the Medicine team for improvement of his heart failure .
He has a long history of alcohol abuse with cirrhosis and dilated cardiomyopathy , presumably due to alcohol .
He has mitral regurgitation , tricuspid regurgitation , and an aortic valve area of 1.1 cm. squared with a peak gradient of 36 to 54 .
He has also had atrial fibrillation since 1990 , which has been rate controlled on Digoxin .
He was recently diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the colon following an episode of bright red blood per rectum and 3.5-cm. sessile lesion at 27 cm. , which was biopsied through a colonoscopy , which revealed adenocarcinoma .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy with an ejection fraction of 20% .
Adenocarcinoma of the colon .
Cirrhosis .
Atrial fibrillation since 1990 .
Recurrent urinary tract infections .
Mitral valve regurgitation of 4+ .
Tricuspid regurgitation .
Aortic stenosis .
Cellulitis and sepsis in 1992 .
Hyponatremia .
Peripheral vascular disease .
ADMISSION MEDICATIONS :
Lasix 40 mg. b.i.d. Tagamet 400 mg. b.i.d. Lisinopril 10 mg. q. day .
Digoxin 0.25 mg. q. day .
Cipro 250 mg. b.i.d.
ALLERGIES :
Sulfa medications .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
His temperature was 99 .
Blood pressure was 104/66 .
Heart rate was 110 .
Oxygen saturation was 97% on room air .
He had jugular venous distention to the level of the jaw in the upright position .
His heart rate was irregularly with a 2/6 holosystolic murmur .
His chest revealed bilateral basilar rales to one-halfway up the chest .
His abdomen was soft and nontender with a positive fluid wave and a liver edge 3 cm. below the costal margin .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted to the Medicine Service and diuresed with Lasix and started on Captopril with the Lisinopril discontinued .
After aggressive diuresis on the Medical Service , he was deemed stable for surgery .
After many discussions between Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Leickgrend</PHI> , the patient , and his family , concerning the severely high risk , given the patient &apos;s conditions , it was decided to proceed with the operation .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/27</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Operating Room where he underwent a sigmoid colectomy under general endotracheal anesthesia .
His fluids were very strongly restricted , and he only received 500 cc. of crystalloid in the Operating Room with 400 cc. of blood loss and 500 cc. of ascites evacuated .
He was taken to the Post-Surgical Intensive Care Unit , intubated and stable .
He continued to have rapid atrial fibrillation and had much difficulty weaning from the ventilator .
He was finally extubated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/10</PHI>/95 , and despite respiratory rates in the 30s and very coarse , rhonchorous breath sounds , the patient continued to have acceptable oxygen saturation and acceptable blood gases on minimal oxygen .
His status , however , remained volatile , and in keeping his volume status somewhat on the dry side to optimize his pulmonary status , he became relatively oliguric and hypernatremic .
He required some fluid boluses with D-5-W to improve his renal function , intravascular volume , and electrolyte balance .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/14</PHI>/95 , he returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit for very aggressive pulmonary toilet .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/15</PHI>/95 , he was taken to the Angio Suite for an attempted transhepatic internal jugular porta caval shunt .
His portal systemic gradient was only 3 mm. , going from 26 to 23 , so no shunt was placed .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/17</PHI> , he spiked a temperature to 103 with rigors and shaking chills .
His respiratory status decompensated acutely , and he required reintubation emergently .
At that time , multiple discussions were held with the family , and they decided to enact a Do Not Resuscitate order .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Stone</PHI> &apos;s renal function continued to deteriorate as well his liver function with rising bilirubin and increasing creatinine .
His urine output remained very low .
His white blood cell count rose to 22,000 with a 50% bandemia .
A Swan-Ganz catheter revealed an SVR of 350 , and he was started on Neo-Synephrine and Epinephrine prior to the Do Not Resuscitate order .
Throughout the day on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/18</PHI>/95 , his blood pressure continued to fall in the 80s , then 70s , then 60s , and at 3:15 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/19</PHI>/95 , despite multiple pressors , his blood pressure dropped down to 50 ; he then went into ventricular fibrillation , followed by flat line .
At that time , he had no spontaneous respirations and no audible heart tones .
He had no carotid pulses , no gag reflex , and no pupillary reflex , and his pupils were fixed and dilated .
He was pronounced dead at 3:15 a.m.
The family was contacted and were present at his bedside .
A postmortem autopsy was requested and denied by the family .

OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Radiation therapy to the right clavicle <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/16</PHI>/2004 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">PUOMC</PHI> admissions for this 88-year-old woman with a history of breast cancer initially diagnosed in 1997 and treated with surgery , radiation , and hormonal treatment .
She had actually completed her five years of Tomaxifin , but was continuing to be plagued by menopausal symptoms and finally in the summery of 2004 understanding the obvious potential risks , she began an estrogen patch .
Not long afterwards she began to develop some bone pains which progressed over the late summer and fall requiring escalation of opiates and restaging confirmed the presence of metastases throughout her spine and in the base of her skull , ribs , arms , etc ... but no visceral involvement .
She ultimately was admitted to the hospital because of delirium and difficulty controlling the pain .
She had no fevers , chills , headaches , or neck stiffness .
There had been no focal neurologic changes .
Up until this admission she had been relatively independent and was very dismayed to discover the extensive relapse of her disease .
On admission to the hospital her temperature was 99 , heart rate 99 , blood pressure 151/87 , O2 saturation on room air was 92% .
She did look mildly dyspneic .
Her lungs were clear .
She had good range of motion throughout except for severe local tenderness and swelling on the mid third of her right clavicle which impaired right shoulder movement .
She was oriented to place and name and this waxed and waned over the next couple of days .
The rest of her neurologic exam was essentially intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 137 , BUN of 25 , creatinine of 0.9 , glucose of 77 , calcium slightly high at 10.9 with an albumin of 3.7 .
Bilirubin normal .
Her ALT 11 , her AST slightly up at 59 .
Her alk phos slightly up at 174 .
WBC 10.8 with normal differential .
Hemoglobin 12.2 , hematocrit 36.6 , MCV 89 , platelets 345,0000 .
A urinalysis showed cloudy urine with 10-20 red cells and 20-50 white cells .
A CA 153 was significantly elevated at 66.5 ( normal 0-30 ) .
The patient was brought to the floor , hydrated gently , given another dose of Zomaten to help with her calcium and over the next few days remained relatively lethargic while we held some of her long acting opiates .
She gradually began to improve and was able to tell if the worst pain was in the right clavicle .
This was assessed promptly by an x-ray that confirmed pathologic fracture of that site .
She also went on to have cervical , thoracic , and lumbosacral MRIs to confirm the wide spread bony metastases in the vertebral bodies and old degenerative changes perhaps with some indentation of the thecal sac but with no radiologic evidence for cord compression .
She had had some urinary hesitancy and difficulty moving her legs in the first few days that had lead to the concern to _________ quinine syndrome but as soon as the opiates were tapered down she was able to void spontaneously and soon began to ambulate with the help of Physical Therapy .
A single fraction to the collar bone seemed to help with pain .
Her bowels required fairly heavy duty osmotic laxatives to keep them open .
The sudden plunge in such a dependent state left her quite depressed and ultimately a small dose of Dexedrine was started partly to overcome the sedation of the opiates and perhaps improve her mood since more traditional antidepressants would take four to six weeks .
PLAN :
Escalate the doses of the Dexedrine perhaps up to a maximum of 10 mg at 8 o&apos;clock in the morning and another 10 mg around noon and see if she can get reasonable sleep at night on this schedule , adding on Remeron at night time for sleep as an antidepressant would be a possibility or to go right to a conventional SSRI overlap until it seems to show more affect .
She lives with her elderly husband and he was appropriately overwhelmed by the prospect of caring for her single-handedly , hence the transfer to a skilled nursing facility for a week or two of rehab .
The patient and husband clearly expressed during this visit that she would not want cardiopulmonary resuscitation or intubation and ventilator support in the event of cardiopulmonary arrest .
She was begun on Letrazole as an ____________ inhibitor for her breast cancer and discussions were begun to consider a possible course or two of Xeloda perhaps at a dose reduced scheduled if she continues to make progress in rehab and can return to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office to have further discussions of this later approach .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Zofran 8 mg p.o. q.8 p.r.n. nausea .
Doculax 5 mg p.o. q.d. p.r.n. Colace 100 mg b.i.d. Senna syrup two teaspoonfuls b.i.d. Mylanta 15-30 mg p.r.n. dyspepsia .
Tylenol 1-2 tabs q.4 p.r.n. pain .
Multivitamin , Megace 200 mg p.o. q.d. ( appetite stimulant ) .
Nexium 20 mg q.d. Femora ( letrazole ) 2.5 mg p.o. q.d. Polyethylene glycol ( Miralax ) 17 gm p.o. q.d. Dilaudid 4 mg p.o. q.4 hours p.r.n. breakthrough pain .
Fragmin 5000 units subq b.i.d. Oxycodone controlled-release ( OxyContin ) 10 mg p.o. q.12 hours .
Dexedrine 5 mg p.o. at 8 a.m.
The patient was discharged in improved , stable , satisfactory condition with the expectation that she will call Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">First</PHI> &apos;s office for a followup visit in about two weeks .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 5 year old male with multiple anomalies transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Capa An- Medical Center</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20</PHI> for management of airway obstruction secondary to tracheal stenosis / history of difficult intubations .
The patient has a history of multiple surgeries and intubations .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/10</PHI>/90 the patient had surgery to remove granulomas in the trachea after traumatic intubation for seizures .
The patient first presented with stridor and respiratory distress on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/92 .
A bronchoscopy at that time showed a 50% tracheal stenosis .
Since then the patient has had intermittent episodes of stridor with agitation with upper respiratory tract infections .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/19</PHI>/92 the patient awoke with significant stridor , respiratory distress and the use of accessory muscles .
The patient was taken to the emergency room where he was taken to the operating room for bronchoscopy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/19</PHI>/92 direct laryngoscopy showed an 80% tracheal stenosis beginning just below the sternal notch involving the proximal 50th percent of the trachea .
They were unable to get to the distal part of the trachea .
The patient was a difficult intubation and it was finally performed by a thoracic surgeon using a 3.5 endotracheal tube .
The patient was then hospitalized in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Asney Ewood Health Care</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Losbroke Pringda Field Delp U</PHI> and maintained with Pavulon and Morphine .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> was consulted and the patient was transferred by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ton Len N&apos;ss Community Hospital</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Pediatric Intensive Care Unit for evaluation and management by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/20</PHI> in the p.m.
The patient was reportedly in his usual state of health immediately prior to this hospitalization with no history of upper respiratory tract infection symptoms , fever , cough , vomiting , diarrhea or decreased appetite .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
1. Respiratory :
The patient remained intubated and maintained on a Pavulon and Morphine drip through until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/21</PHI>/92 .
The patient was brought to the Operating Room where bronchoscopy was done .
The patient was noted to have a stenosis of the proximal trachea approximately 3 cm long just below the vocal cords .
The patient was also noted to have mild right mainstem bronchus stenosis too .
Very mild .
The patient had a 3-0 Shiley trach placed approximately 1 cm below the vocal cords .
The trach extends approximately 1 cm below the area of stenosis .
Chest X-Rays shows clear lung fields bilaterally with the trach tube noted to be in good position .
I should also note that the patient has had multiple tracheal aspirates sent for culture and they have all been negative .
There is one Gram stain that showed some polys but otherwise they have been unremarkable .
There is no clinical evidence of pneumonia that could have precipitated this event and all X-Rays have been unremarkable .
The patient has a history of significant hyperinflation of the chest with an increased AP diameter which is mildly improved after the tracheostomy .
The patient received oxygen for approximately 24 hours after the tracheostomy and is presently being maintained on room air with a humidified mask .
The patient generally breaths between 20 and 30 breaths per minute and is otherwise stable .
Cardiac :
The patient is otherwise stable .
The patient had some evidence of doubled T waves on the day of arrival .
These T waves have since cleared and the patient is otherwise unremarkable .
Please note that the last arterial blood gases was Ph 7.40 , PCO2 of 41 , PO2 of 112 , bicarbonate of 25 .
Fluids and Nutrition :
The patient was initially NPO and then begun on Pediasure feeds the first two days of hospitalization .
The patient has presently been weaned over to his regular diet which is generally some crackers , cereal and occasional bits of food .
The patient generally does not drink much fluid .
GI :
From a gastrointestinal point of view please note on ______________ at 5 a.m. the patient was noted to be aspirating bits of cereal and juices via his trach tube .
This was felt to be mild aspiration .
The patient also had episodes of frequent coughing .
Clinical examination shows no decreased breath sounds .
The repeat X-Ray is generally clear and the patient is generally in no distress .
The patient was made NPO on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/25</PHI> a.m. Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fields</PHI> &apos;s team is coming to evaluate the patient .
Recommendations include probable evaluation for aspiration of upper airway contents and possible G tube placement in the future .
The patient has a history of longstanding constipation generally requires an enema every couple of days .
KUB on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/23</PHI> showed hugely dilated loops of colon and small bowel which only briefly respond to an enema .
The patient last received enema on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/24</PHI> in the p.m.
HEM :
The patient has generally been stable .
His initial hematocrit was 31% .
His hematocrit on transfer was 33% .
The platelet count was 351,000 .
The patient never received blood during the procedure .
The estimated blood loss was minimal .
Renal :
The patient has always had good urine output with normal BUN and creatinine .
Neurological :
The patient has a history of of seizure disorder .
He has been stable here .
He is presently being weaned off his Phenobarbital and advanced onto Tegretol by his Neurologist in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vanri , SC</PHI> .
Levels on arrival showed a Phenobarbital level of 25 , Tegretrol level of 3.1 .
The patient has had problems taking p.o. Tegretol during this hospitalization and levels need to be checked in the near future .
Phenobarbital has been maintained by intravenous 30 mg b.i.d.
Infectious Disease :
The patient arrived receiving ceftriaxone for one day down in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</PHI> .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
METASTATIC CERVICAL CARCINOMA .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSES INCLUDE PERICARDIAL EFFUSION , PULMONARY LYMPHANGITIC SPREAD , AND LIVER AND SPLEEN METASTASES .
OPERATIONS AND PROCEDURES :
Echocardiogram times two .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .
Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vanor</PHI> .
Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .
Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .
On ultrasound in <PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .
She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .
The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .
She was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .
She was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Weekscook University Medical Center</PHI> with a diagnosis of possible asthma .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .
Given the patient &apos;s history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .
She was therefore transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further care .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02</PHI>/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">03</PHI>/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Prednisone 20 mg p.o. q.a.m. with 10 mg p.o. q.p.m. , Uniphyl 400 mg p.o. q.d. , Augmentin 250 p.o. t.i.d. , Estrase 2 mg p.o. q.d. , MS Contin 30 mg q.12h. , and Morphine p.r.n.
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Emaciated white female in mild respiratory distress .
Temperature was 98.1 , heart rate 116 , blood pressure 120/68 , and room air O2 saturation was 93% .
HEENT :
Dry mucous membranes and myotic pupils .
NECK :
No lymphadenopathy .
CHEST :
Few inspiratory wheezes and no rhonchi .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with tachycardia and no rubs or murmur .
ABDOMEN :
Well healed Pfannenstiel scars and no masses .
PELVIC :
No masses .
RECTAL :
No masses and guaiac negative .
EXTREMITIES :
No edema or cyanosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit was 40 , white count was 21 , and platelet count of 723,000 .
PT and PTT were 12 and 26 .
Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .
There was no evidence of tamponade .
An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .
Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .
Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .
She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .
Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .
They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .
She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .
Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .
She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/14</PHI> and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .
Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .
EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .
She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient &apos;s cycle without any change in the effusion from <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/11</PHI> .
Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .
She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .
She underwent her CT scan .
This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .
Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .
Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI> .
She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/19</PHI> and Ifex and Mesna on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> .
She was noted , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/16</PHI> , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .
Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .
They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .
The patient &apos;s shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .
Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .
Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .
They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .
She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/18</PHI> originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .
The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .
She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .
Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .
She was hooked up with support services in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961</PHI> for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .
She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/22</PHI>/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mielke</PHI> and home care services .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Premarin 0.625 q.d. , Proventil Inhaler two puffs q.i.d. , Beclovent four puffs b.i.d. , Colace 100 mg p.o. t.i.d. , MS Contin 30 mg p.o. t.i.d. , Elavil 25 mg p.o. q.h.s. , Trilisate 750 mg p.o. b.i.d. , MS Elixir 100 mg p.o. q.2h. p.r.n. , Robitussin with Codeine 5 cc p.o. q.2h. , and home O2 two liters via nasal prong with increase to four liters as needed for symptoms p.r.n.

Esophageal carcinoma-metastatic .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Lymphangetic pulmonary carcinomatosis , dyspnea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Bronchoscopy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/23</PHI>/95 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> is a 53 year-old white male with a history of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus who is admitted with a 10-day history of progressive dyspnea on exertion .
Briefly , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> presented in 1992 with dysphagia and a midesophageal mass that proved to be squamous cell carcinoma .
He received two cycles of neoadjuvant Cisplatin and 5-FU , followed by esophagectomy , followed by two cycles of adjuvant platinum/5-FU .
He was without evidence of disease until the <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of 1994 , when he developed an inferior vena cava thrombosis and CT scan revealed celiac axis adenopathy .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of 1994 , pulmonary disease , consistent with lymphangetic spread of tumor , was present .
He began Ifosfamide chemotherapy but in the last few cycles has had progressive disease .
Over the last 10 days , he has been bothered by progressive dyspnea on exertion .
He has seen two local physicians , who have tried him first on Bactrim and subsequently Clarithromycin without improvement .
He denies fevers , chills , hemoptysis , chest pain , nausea and vomiting , or diarrhea .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1) Remarkable for a history of ulcers .
2) Inferior vena cava occlusion .
3) Arthritis .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Atrovent , Proventil , Azmacort , Serevent inhalers .
Coumadin , Tagamet , and Clarithromycin .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , the patient is afebrile , tachypneic , and tachycardic .
Skin is pale .
The head , eyes , ears , nose , throat exam reveals mild proptosis .
He has total alopecia .
His neck is supple .
There is no thyroid , cervical , or supraclavicular adenopathy .
His lungs reveal diffuse wheezes , especially in the left chest .
There is minimal air movement on the left lower lobe .
The rest of his physical examination was unremarkable .
LABORATORY DATA :
Laboratory studies on admission included a BUN and creatinine of 14 and 1.4 , normal calcium , white count of 12,100 , hematocrit of 32 , platelet count of 319,000 .
PT was 19.8 seconds .
His three liter nasal prong blood gas revealed a PO2 of 63 , PCO2 of 47 , pH of 7.39 .
A chest X-ray revealed diffuse air space disease , particularly on the left .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a diagnostic impression of probable progressive carcinoma with a potential component of bronchospasm .
However , there was the possibility that this represented an atypical pulmonary infection .
Hence , he went to bronchoscopy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jesclinke</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/22</PHI>/95 .
Bronchoscopy revealed clear airways without evidence of significant secretions .
BAL was sent for culture and was negative for pathogenic organisms .
A few days after bronchoscopy , his intravenous Bactrim was discontinued and he was treated with oxygen , steroids , and inhalers .
It was felt that there were no further chemotherapy options for this disease and he met with hospice therapy .
In addition , he was hypoxic throughout his admission , often with oxygen saturations in the high 80s despite five liters of supplemental oxygen .
This was accompanied with some anxiety , which was treated with intermittent morphine and Ativan .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Mar 30</PHI> , 1995 with hospice care .
His status is DNR .

HISTORY AND REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Granrivern Call</PHI> is a 79-year-old right handed white male with a history of questionable progressive supranuclear palsy , atrial fibrillation , deep venous thrombosis , and pulmonary embolus who presents with a change in mental status and a fall at home .
His family stated that he had a progressive mental decline over the past three years and was initially diagnosed with Parkinson &apos;s disease or features consistent with Parkinsonism .
This was poorly responsive to Eldopa .
He was later seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Flo Cuchkote</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and diagnosed with progressive supranuclear palsy .
Over the five to six weeks prior to admission he had a drop off in his mental functioning with more frequent episodes of confusion and disorientation and requiring more assistance with his activities of daily living .
He also developed a urinary incontinence .
He had had two falls to his wife &apos;s recollection , both times slipping off the edge of a chair backwards .
On the morning of admission at 8 o&apos;clock , he was noted to be moving his mouth less and speaking &quot; gibberish &quot; .
He was later sitting in a chair making multiple attempts to get up , which he subsequently did and promptly fell directly on his face at approximately 11:30 a.m.
There was no definite clonic activity .
There was no known incontinence .
He was taken to an outside hospital and nasally intubated and then transferred to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> Emergency Room where he was orally intubated .
A trauma evaluation was negative and thus he was transferred to the Neurology Service .

FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a father who had dementia .
There was no history of strokes or bleeding disorders in the family .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
vital signs in the emergency room were 210/100 for blood pressure , heart rate 70 and irregular .
He was afebrile .
In general he was an intubated elderly frail appearing white male with blood about his face .

SUMMARY OF LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS :
sodium 141 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 107 , bicarbonates 23.8 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 165 , PO2 377 , PCO2 32 , PH 7.50 , asomus 298 , toxic screen negative , white blood cell count 11.1 , hematocrit 39.6 , platelet count 137 , prothrombin time 25.2 , INR 4.3 , partial thromboplastin time 34.7 , urinalysis 1+ albumin, 0-5 high link caths , cervical spine negative , pelvis negative , lumbar spine ; negative , thoracic spine negative .
chest x-ray clear .
electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .
Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .
There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
1) NEUROLOGY :
The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .
He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .
It did , however , show diffuse slowing .
He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .
His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .
He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .
He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .
His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .
It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .
It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson &apos;s disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .
He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 18</PHI> , 1996 .
This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .
In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .
However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .
The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .
2) CARDIOVASCULAR :
His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .
He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .
He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .
That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small &quot; leaflet &quot; .
He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .
3) PULMONARY :
After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .
He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .
However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .
4) HEMATOLOGY :
He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .
His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .
It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .
He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .
It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .
5) GASTROINTESTINAL :
He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .
Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 19</PHI> , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .
In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .
However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .
The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .
DISPOSITION / PLAN ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient was to be discharged to a rehabilitation hospital , the location of which was undetermined at this time of this discharge summary .
The patient is to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ria</PHI> in clinic on one month time and the family is to call me if there were any questions in the interim .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
CHORDOMA .
PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">1/22</PHI>/97 Right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor with laminectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> is a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .
An initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .
He was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .
A follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .
He was treated with aspirin .
<PHI TYPE="DATE">November 19</PHI> , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .
Postoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .
He was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 25</PHI> , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .
Now preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .
He is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Status post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .
DIET :
Jevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .
ALLERGIES :
The patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Aspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Denies use of alcohol and tobacco .
He is married and lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nebraska</PHI> , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Heart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .
General :
This is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .
HEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .
Lungs are clear to auscultation .
Heart regular rate and rhythm , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Abdomen G-tube intact , soft non-tender , active bowel sounds .
Neurological alert and oriented times three , speech is fluent although there is some difficulty of tongue movement .
Cranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .
Strength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .
Cerebella intact .
Gait steady .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jan 22</PHI> , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .
Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .
He was extubated on postoperative day number one .
His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .
He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .
He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .
He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .
On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .
He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .
A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .
A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .
A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .
He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .
He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .
A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .
Because of continuing complaints by Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .
He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Feb 04</PHI> , 1997 .
Prior to admission Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .
After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .
It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .
His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .
His lumbar drain was removed after five days .
He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .
He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .
2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.
He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .
FOLLOW-UP :
Follow-up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sick</PHI> in one weeks time .
He will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .
ADDENDUM
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Marker</PHI> will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.
2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .

DEATH SUMMARY
PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
BONE MARROW TRANSPLANTATION FOR LYMPHOMA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 61-year-old white man with a history of mediastinal lymphoma who was admitted for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
The patient was diagnosed with lymphoma in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> of 1988 when a biopsy of her left cervical node revealed T cell versus Hodgkin &apos;s lymphoma .
He underwent intensive chemotherapy and entered a complete remission .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">08</PHI>/89 , he developed B symptoms and work-up revealed relapse in the mediastinum , retroperitoneum , and bone marrow .
He underwent salvage chemotherapy and again went into remission .
He was then admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/90 for autologous bone marrow transplantation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for hypertension .
Right mastectomy for benign lesion .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed the patient to be afebrile with a blood pressure of 160/90 and a heart rate of 80 .
Respirations were 16 .
His physical examination was noteable only for the following .
His lungs were clear .
Cardiac exam was normal .
Abdomen was benign .
The remainder of his physical examination was normal except for decreased vibration and position sense in the distal fingers and toes .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission revealed a normal SMA-7 except for potassium of 3.1 .
His liver function tests showed a mildly elevated alkaline phosphatase at 139 but was otherwise normal .
Hematocrit was 29.3 .
White blood cell count was 4.5 .
The remainder of his laboratory studies were normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent conditioning with Cytoxan , VP-16 , and VCNU .
His initial hospital course was complicated by the following :
1. Fever and neutropenia :
The patient developed fever and neutropenia without any clear source .
He was treated with multiple antibiotics including ceftazidime , gentamicin , vancomycin and ampho .
Despite this , the fevers persisted until he no longer was neutropenic .
2. Renal occlusive disease :
Starting on approximately day 14 , the patient developed signs of renal occlusive disease with increasing bilirubin .
This progressed inexorably until he developed massive ascites and marked hyperbilirubinemia .
Multiple abdominal ultrasound revealed no biliary dilatation ; there was evidence of gallbladder polyps versus stones on one ultrasound .
Despite aggressive supportive care , the patient &apos;s liver pathology did not resolve and he continued to have progressive hepatic failure .
Towards the end of the hospitalization , his bilirubins were in the high 30&apos;s and low 40&apos;s .
3. Renal failure :
Despite aggressive attempts to maintain his intravascular volume , the patient &apos;s renal function progressively declined .
He received multiple transfusions with coloids , including red blood cells and albumin .
Despite maximal efforts with coloids , renal range dopamine and Lasix , the patient &apos;s creatinine continued to rise .
4. Respiratory :
Because of mechanical limitations imposed by his ascites , the patient had severe tachypnea and required supplemental oxygen to maintain his oxygenation .
Despite a very aggressive approach to his care , the patient continued to decline .
Therefore , in close discussion with the family , he was made DNR .
The patient &apos;s clinical situation continued to deteriorate and he died on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/9</PHI>/90 at 4:30 a.m.
An autopsy was refused .

The patient &apos;s course was subsequently characterized by recurrent pneumonias , possibly due to aspiration , and by hemodynamic instability .
He was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit from the Transplant Service for ventilatory management in the setting of hypotension .
On transfer , the patient was not sedated , but was unresponsive and extremely dyssynchronous with the ventilator .
The patient was found to have substantial auto PEEP with an elevated dead space .
A pulmonary arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/03</PHI>/98 demonstrated multiple pulmonary emboli , likely less than one week old , possibly introduced at the time of the renal vein thrombosis of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/19</PHI>/97 .
An inferior vena cava filter was placed ; lower extremity noninvasive studies were negative .
The patient required high pressures to ventilate adequately , possibly related to an abdominal compartment syndrome .
The patient had undergone two abdominal procedures following explantation .
The physiology at the time of transfer to the Medical Intensive Care Unit was consistent with a septic process .
CT scan demonstrated retroperitoneal collection containing both free air and extravasated contrast material .
For the concern of a perforated viscus , the patient was taken to exploratory laparotomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/06</PHI>/98 , during which the bowel was run without evidence of perforation .
The patient remained unstable .
He was taken to fluoroscopy , where oral contrast was demonstrated to be extravasating through a posterior duodenum .
For this reason , he was taken again to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/98 , at which time a gastrojejunostomy was performed with stapling across the gastroduodenal junction , introduction of five Jackson-Pratt drains into the retroperitoneal mass , cholecystotomy tube , gastrostomy tube , and jejunostomy tube .
The patient had an extensive estimated blood loss requiring multiple blood products and fluid resuscitation therapy .
Accompanying this during this period were elevations in liver function studies and amylase and lipase consistent with pancreatic inflammation .
The patient was aggressively treated with fluid resuscitation and pressors for his septic physiology .
There was no evidence of cardiac tamponade or specific underlying coronary dysfunction .
He was treated with appropriate antibiotics for his Serratia pneumonia , as well as for his abdominal process .
The patient was felt to have an underlying hypercoagulable state , thought to be the source for the repeated clots .
Because of the bleeding problems , however , it was felt that full heparinization would not be prudent , and the patient was treated with pneumo-boots and subcutaneous heparin .
Attention was paid to a variety of metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities , which were corrected appropriately .
Nonetheless , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> continued to remain critically ill with only very transient mild improvement with drainage of additional retroperitoneal fluid .
He remained pressor dependent , as well as dependent upon mechanical ventilatory assistance .
His course was complicated by atrial fibrillation requiring cardioversion .
He had an ongoing requirement for high volume resuscitation and was persistently acidotic despite CV-VVH in the face of bicarbonate replenishment .
The patient also appeared to have stool from his Jackson-Pratt site and right oblique incision .
Bloody drainage from his increasingly distended abdomen was noted .
Extensive discussions were carried out with Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Less</PHI> condition was irretrievable .
It was felt that the patient had continued massive retroperitoneal contamination and probable multiple enteric fistulae from an ischemic bowel .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cantsleddjesc</PHI> felt that no surgical approach to this problem or further intervention or radiologic procedures would be helpful .
All physicians and the family were in agreement that the most appropriate approach was to institute comfort measures .
This was done , and the patient appeared to be comfortable at the time of death with his family at his side on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/16</PHI>/98 .

Chemotherapy of IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida 0 with stage IV endometrial cancer and stage III-C ovarian cancer vs metastatic endometrial cancer for line 2 , cycle 1 chemotherapy .
The patient presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 , with heavy bleeding per vagina .
D and C showed grade II-III adenocarcinoma with squamous differentiation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Com St. , Tton , Arkansas 32167</PHI> .
The patient underwent TAH / BSO , partial omentectomy at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="DATE">10</PHI>-90 .
At that time , tumor was found to be studding on the right diaphragm , gross tumor in the omentum and large bowel , tumor through the uterine serosa .
Pathology showed grade II-III papillary adenocarcinoma of the endometrium with squamous differentiation which was focally invasive and superficial myometrium .
The ovary showed papillary serous adeno with omental involvement consistent with an endometroid adenocarcinoma .
The question was whether or not whether she had two primaries vs metastatic endometrial cancer .
The patient underwent 6 cycles of CAP in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pemrancetul Tonsst.</PHI> .
However , during the fourth cycle , Cytoxan was dropped .
Her CA-125 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6-27</PHI>-91 , was 249 and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-29</PHI>-91 , was 734 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>-92 , the patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Wellla Uxinny:mount Medical Center</PHI> with left leg DVT and started on Heparin therapy .
She was discharged from there on Coumadin therapy .
On admission , the patient has no complaints except anxiety .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative except as above .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Coumadin 5 mg po q d , Tagamet 400 mg po q d , Amoxicillin which was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Labor Day</PHI> , for a sore throat and Ativan 1 mg po prn nausea / anxiety .
ALLERGIES :
The patient gets hives to aspirin and tomatoes also cause her hives .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The temp was 99.4 , BP 114/78 , pulse 128 and respirations 20 .
She was an anxious female , in no acute distress .
HEENT exam showed PERRLA , EOMI , oropharynx benign .
The lungs were clear to auscultation .
CV was regular rate and rhythm without murmurs .
The abdomen was soft , positive bowel sounds , non tender , large , hard mass occupying the lower abdomen and left upper quadrant .
The extremities were non tender without edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
On admission , the sodium was 136 , potassium 3.0 , chloride 98 , CO2 20 , BUN 8 , creatinine 0.8 and glucose 94 , ALT 5 , AST 10 , LDH 166 , alkaline phosphatase 81 , total bili 0.6 , direct bili .3 , albumin 3.3 , calcium 8.8 and uric acid 3.1 .
She had CA-125 which was pending at the time of discharge .
Her hematocrit was 31.1 , WBC 11.6 and 151,000 platelets .
PLAN :
The patient is thus stage IV endometrial and stage III-C ovarian vs metastatic endometrial for line II , cycle I chemotherapy IFEX , MESNA and VP-16 .
The plan was for urinalysis q d.
With the history of DVT , we plan Coumadin and check her coags .
The patient was tachycardiac on admission and it was felt she was dehydrated and / or anxious at the time of her initial evaluation .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia and incomplete right bundle branch block .
When compared with ECG of <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-06</PHI>-90 , there was borderline criteria for anterior MI although the patient denied any chest pain at any point .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient underwent chemotherapy on the following doses :
IFEX 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days , MESNA 1.2 grams per meter squared x 3 days continuous IV infusion .
She had VP-16 mixed with 250 cc IV fluid given over 1 hour each day for 3 days .
She also had MESNA dose of .6 grams per meter squared after her IFEX / MESNA were completed .
The patient &apos;s urinalysis on admission was significant for red blood cells which were TNTC as well as uric acid .
Because it was felt the patient was bleeding and the patient was contaminated , she received her IFEX / MESNA .
A repeat straight cath was negative for RBC&apos;s .
After 1 day of chemotherapy , the patient had 8-10 RBC&apos;s in her urine but by the second day of her IFEX infusion , she had 50-80 RBC&apos;s in her urine as well as a few transitional epithelial cells .
Because of this finding , her IFEX was stopped before completion of her second day of infusion .
Her MESNA alone was continued at that time for IV infusion .
She did receive her VP-16 without complication .
Other significant issues were the patient &apos;s hematocrit on admission at 31.1 which dwindled down to 26.2 by <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-10</PHI> .
The patient was counselled and received 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s at that time .
However , the patient &apos;s hematocrit bumped only to 28.1 and a repeat later on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-11</PHI> , showed hematocrit of 27.6 .
At this time , an additional 2 units of packed RBC&apos;s were transfused .
The third issue was that her anticoagulation was grossly out of control on admission with PT of 25.6 and PTT of 42.2 .
Her repeat on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-8</PHI> , was 36.0/68.2 and her Coumadin was held .
She received no Coumadin during her admission and by the time of discharge , her PT was down to 16.2 .
She was restarted on Coumadin 2.5 mg per day .
The patient &apos;s hematocrit on the day of discharge was 35.6 showing significant bump in her count after her second two units of packed RBC&apos;s .
Her PT on the day of discharge was 13.2 and she was started on Coumadin 2.5 mg po q d as mentioned .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9-12</PHI>-92 , with the approval of her attending physiciana , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Porriede Friednantflirt</PHI> .
FOLLOW UP CARE :

He was monitored closely and started on folic acid .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> 2002 , a bone marrow biopsy showed MDS with a 12p abnormality in 14/24 metaphases .
He was treated with 5-azacytidine due to increasing number of blasts .
After four treatment cycles , his marrow remained hypercellular with persistent low levels of blasts .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 2004 , the patient converted to AML with Philadelphia chromosome 9:12 and received induction chemotherapy and recovered slowly with blasts .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> 2005 , a bone marrow biopsy showed 80% cellularity and 40% of the intratrabecular space was composed of AML cells .
Hydrea was started due to splenic pain .
The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 5</PHI> , 2005 for many &quot; peripheral blood stem cell transplants . &quot;
This course was without major complications .
Since his discharge from the hospital one week ago , he had twin graft to stem cells .
He has had only a few polys on his white blood cell differential .
He has also had persistent blasts of 1 to 2% .
The patient was taken off GMCSF because of splenic pain and this pain improved .
He has not been febrile .
He has had transfusions on several occasions .
His white blood cell count and platelet count have been noted to be steadily rising over the past week .
He actually looked a little bit better today than he had previously .
For the past three days , he has been complaining of pain in his shoulder with motion and also a little bit of pain in his left lower quadrant .
A chest x-ray obtained demonstrated a right lobe infiltrate , which was possibly fungal in etiology and the patient has been admitted for further evaluation and treatment .

She noted that he was actively working full time and was a sales representative at the <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Leigh</PHI> and lives at home with her and his daughter , age 18 .
It was felt that , because of the evidence of congestive heart failure and the critical left main lesion , he should be admitted for further evaluation .
Indeed , he was treated with diuretics and nitrates along with cessation of his aspirin , and he was put on IV Heparin .
He stabilized over the weekend .
He was noted to have some ventricular ectopy on Holter monitor .
He developed epigastric pain on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/31</PHI> which previously had been ignored but in retrospect was probably his anginal equivalent .
He also had multifocal ventricular ectopy at that time .
He had some further anterolateral ST segment changes .
Therefore , he did have unstable angina with his critical coronary anatomy .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Electrophysiology service , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> , who said that he had no indication for patch placement at the time of surgery .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/02</PHI>/93 , an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed ; then , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thorebreutz</PHI> took him to the operating room , where he had quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting .
He had a left internal mammary artery graft of the LAD , a single saphenous vein to the right coronary artery with 280 cc per minute flow , and a saphenous vein snake graft to the diagonal and circumflex with 150 cc per minute flow .
A paraphimosis was noted and treated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ryna Jescdrig</PHI> .
After surgery he had a ongoing sinus tachycardia .
He was able to be rapidly weaned and extubated .
He had good hemodynamics .
He had occasional atrial and ventricular premature beats .
His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned the following day and he was transferred out of the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
He was seen in consultation by the Nutrition Service , who followed him for dietary management of his diabetes mellitus .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/05</PHI> it was noted that his platelet count had fallen from 171,000 to 54,000 ; this was thought to be associated with intravenous Heparin and indeed , when Heparin was discontinued , since it had been restarted after surgery , his platelet count rebounded to normal .
Therefore , he does have a thrombocytopenic reaction to Heparin .
He remained in normal sinus rhythm .
He did have runs of nonsustained ventricular tachycardia , which were clinically stable .
He had a right bundle branch block .
He is at increased risk for future events because of his low left ventricular ejection fraction , but he is clinically stable on ACE inhibitors , Digoxin , Coumadin , and aspirin .
Therefore he was able to be discharged home .
He understands that he does have significant left ventricle dysfunction and requires monitoring of his prothrombin times and his arrhythmias ; these will be done in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Grovea Co Terburgperv Portnew</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Ischemic cardiomyopathy , orthotopic heart transplantation , hyperlipidemia , hypertension , coronary graft disease , medical noncompliance .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
Cardiac echocardiogram .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
None .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> is a 49-year-old man status post orthotopic heart transplantation in 1991 at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Dautenorwe Stuart Erec Hillpa Of Hospital</PHI> who is admitted with dyspnea and severe heart failure .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vessels</PHI> &apos;s postoperative course has been marked by CMV infection , hypertension , poorly controlled lipids , peripheral vascular disease , and chronic renal insufficiency with a creatinine of 1.8 or so .
Recently he had documented coronary angiography based on a catheterization performed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1996 with moderate to diffuse atherosclerosis .
A repeat angiogram performed a year later showed marked progression of coronary allograft disease .
A biopsy at that time revealed grade 1B rejection with endothelialitis and eosinophils .
He was treated with pulsed IV steroids and Imuran , was augmented with mycophenolate Mofetil .
Chest x-ray showed cariogenic pulmonary edema and he was faring poorly .
Prior to admission he was seen approximately 1 week in the office with mild congestive heart failure .
An echocardiogram then revealed an ejection fraction of 40% and an endomyocardial biopsy revealed no ejection .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease , coronary allograft vasculopathy , hyperlipidemia , peripheral vascular disease , CMV infection , hypertension , depression , and tricuspid regurgitation .
Examination revealed a tired , fatigued man with cool extremities .
His blood pressure is 130/80 and heart rate was 100. jugular venous pressure was increasing .
Carotids were 2+ .
Crackles were increased 1/4 of the way up .
There was a left ventricular heave and an S3 galop .
The abdomen was soft and nontender with a palpable liver edge and the pulses were diminished .
LABORATORY DATA :
Revealed a sodium 136 , potassium 4.5 , BUN 47 , creatinine 2.4 , glucose 136. hematocrit 40% .
The electrocardiogram revealed poor R wave progression and marked decrease in all volts .
chest x-ray revealed prominent pulmonary vessels and enlarged heart .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital via the emergency room where a bedside echocardiogram was performed .
The echocardiogram revealed no pericardial effusion , an ejection fraction of 30% and worsening systolic dysfunction .
Hydrocortisone was given 1 g in an attempt to reverse what was thought to be aggressive coronary allograft vasculopathy .
The patient diuresed and responded to Lasix 100 mg administered in the emergency room and was admitted to a monitored bed .
At 4:30 AM the following morning the patient was found in cardiac arrest .
Despite intravenous fluids , intravenous epinephrine , and multiple attempts at defibrillation , the patient was unable to be resuscitated .
Upon arrival of the covering access physician the patient was being ventilated mechanically and CPR was being performed .
The rhythm revealed sinus tachycardia with no palpable or measurable blood pressure .
There were also runs of ventricular tachycardia which generated into ventricular fibrillation that was refractory to multiple cardioversions .
A pericardiocentesis was attempted with no yield of pericardial fluid .
A transvenous pacing wire was attempted and a pacing rhythm was obtained but with no palpable blood pressure .
In total , the patient was defibrillated 10 times , given 5 courses of intravenous epinephrine , one course of intravenous Atropine and intravenous calcium x 1 in addition to an amp of bicarbonate .
The resuscitation efforts were discontinued at 4:15 AM and were begun at 3:38 AM .
The patient was pronounced dead .
Patient &apos;s mother was informed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Vessels</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
STATUS POST MULTIPLE EMBOLISMS AND LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBUS PROCEDURES :
LEFT VENTRICULAR THROMBECTOMY .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 63 year old patient who had no significant medical history until 1987 , when he developed a left arm embolism which was treated with SVG from the left thigh .
The postop course was uncomplicated with an embolus occluding the graft and a CVA .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">04</PHI>-90 , the patient suffered an intestinal embolism requiring an ileostomy which was closed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>-90 , the patient developed a second CVA presenting with slurred speech which resolved without residual .
The patient presents now with a 3 month history of dizziness and mood changes .
He also complains of continued left arm paresthesias .
The patient also reports that he had a large silent MI in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>-89 , which was uncomplicated .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission to the Medical Service , the patient underwent work up for embolism source and source for his dizziness .
His search had previously been negative .
A recent echo showed 1+ MR , inferior apical and left ventricular akinesis and a 3 x 2.5 cm spherical mass in the inferior apical left ventricle .
This finding was in concurrence with findings of a cardiac cath performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-12</PHI>-92 .
The patient was then transferred to the Cardiac Surgery Service for the removal of this left ventricular mass .
Coronary angiography during the cardiac cath had revealed normal coronaries without coronary artery disease .
After the usual preparation , the patient was taken to the OR on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-14</PHI>-92 , and underwent left ventriculotomy and removal of the left ventricular thrombus .
The pathological examination of the removed material revealed a blood clot with thrombus .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
During the early postop period , he was kept on IV Dextran and was restarted on Coumadin .
His further postop course was complicated by a recurrent episode of dizziness .
His neurologic work up , however , was negative .
A repeat echo showed no recurrent intraventricular thrombus and a carotid Doppler study was negative .
The patient suffered no further dizzy spells during the further postop days .
He was discharged in good condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-22</PHI>-92 .
DISPOSITION :
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Synthroid .1 mg po q d , Metamucil one pack po q d , Persantine 50 mg po t.i.d. , Lopressor 25 mg po b.i.d. , Anusol cream at anal t.i.d. , Coumadin for PTT equal 20 seconds as directed , Albuterol inhaler two puffs q 6 h prn .
FOLLOW UP CARE :
Since our Hematology consultant recommended to keep the patient &apos;s PT in the range of 20-22 seconds , the patient will require close follow up of his PT&apos;s while on Coumadin .
This was discussed with the patient &apos;s local medical doctor , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Royneo Walla</PHI> .
The patient will receive further follow up including evoked potential studies by our Neurology Service .
He has an appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">O Kotea</PHI> for his cardiac surgical follow up 4 weeks post discharge .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mrs. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Shuff</PHI> was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> because of the development of a sudden marked increase in her level of dyspnea .
She was known to have metastatic small cell lung carcinoma for which she had been treated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Iand Bontbreun</PHI> with multiple courses of chemotherapy as well as localized radiation therapy .
She had recently had cerebral metastases , which was treated by aspiration and is also known to have bone metastases .
A few days prior to admission she developed severe dyspnea .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she was markedly dyspneic , sitting upright and completely unable to lie flat .
She has small amounts of active hemoptysis , no evidence of superior mediastinal syndrome .
The heart rate was 110 per minute , chest showed diffuse rhonchi throughout .
Decreased breath sounds right upper lobe .
No murmur , rub or gallop or cardiomegaly was noted .
One finger hepatomegaly was present without splenomegaly and there was no peripheral edema .
The arterial blood gases on room air sitting upright PO2 67 mm. Mercury , PCO2 42 mm. Mercury , pH 7.47. hematocrit 41.4 , sodium 123 , potassium 3.5 , chloride 88 , BUN 12 , creatinine .6 mg. % , LDH 692 , units , alkaline phosphatase 234 units , her chest X-ray showed consolidation of the right upper lobe and a markedly elevated right hemidiaphragm .
A computerized tomography scan taken in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1995 showed marked atelectasis of the right middle lobe and right upper lobe , with marked intraolobular septal thickening , probably representing interstitial carcinoma , and a markedly dilated right hilum .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Oarekote</PHI> from the Department of chemotherapy , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Skizeis</PHI> from Radiation Therapy , both of whom conclude that they did not have any additional therapy , which would improve her condition .
She had a bronchoscopy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cranka</PHI> , which showed diffuse involvement and narrowing of the bronchi to the right lung by extrinsic compression .
Essentially this excluded both coring or laser removal of central airway tumor as well as endobronchial brachy therapy .
Her sodium slowly increased in the hospital and was 129 mEq on discharge .
She was discharged to be cared for at home or possibly in the Hospice at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Vaila Medical Center</PHI> .

The patient was admitted with the chief complaint of gait ataxia and decline in memory .
The patient is a 71-year-old right-handed white female with a history of confusion and difficulty with speech for about one year .
A CAT scan done at that time , of the head , showed tumor in the left frontal region .
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> , Doctor <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lou</PHI> , <PHI TYPE="DATE">02-15</PHI>-90 , operated and removed the tumor via craniotomy incision .
The patient received radiation therapy and the tumor resolved completely on the CAT scan .
The patient did well until <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1991 , when a followup CAT scan showed hydrocephalus and symptoms were increasing , of sleep , but she also had a high phenobarbital level .
A lumbar puncture was done ; results are unknown , but with a decrease in her pheno-barbital level she did well .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> the tumor regrew and the patient received interferon and BCNU therapy until <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> .
This was limited by her decreasing blood counts .
CAT scan prior to <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/29</PHI> , the tumor showed shrinkage of about 80% but increasing hydrocephalus .
The lumbar puncture was ineffective for the treatment of the hydrocephalus .
The patient progressed to be more sleepy , her language was more sparse , she was more confused and weak , and incontinent .
She recurred with some seizures , and underwent admission this time for evaluation for a ventriculo-peritoneal VP shunt placement for the hydrocephalus .

ALLERGIES are no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination was not documented on the chart .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , hematocrit was 37 , baseline creatinine .9 .
postoperatively , her hematocrit fell to as low as 23.8 , for which she was transfused up to hematocrit of 33 and remained stable between 30 and 33 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to surgery on the day of admission , where she underwent exploratory laparotomy and a 5-centimeter tumor mass was identified , which was adherent and possibly intrinsic to the sigmoid colon , and also noted were firm and large periaortic lymph nodes bilaterally .
Because of these operative findings , only a biopsy was sent , which confirmed metastatic clear cell carcinoma , and further bowel surgery was not attempted .
Postoperatively , the patient &apos;s course was complicated initially by a falling hematocrit , which was transfused and then remained stable .
The she continued to have low-grade postoperative fevers until approximately 8 days postoperatively when her temperature spiked .
A pelvic ultrasound was obtained , which showed a large fluid collection in the pelvis .
This collection was tapped and found to be blood mixed with pus .
A drain was placed under ultrasound guidance and cultures were sent .
Cultures so far have grown suspected Pseudomonas from the liquid medium only , sensitivities are pending .
The patient was placed on ampicillin , gentamicin and Flagyl , and the fluid collection was drained over 4 days .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient is a 55 year old white female with dilated cardiomyopathy , status post ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/04</PHI>/94 .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further therapy , and transplant evaluation .
Patient also received AICD .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was initially admitted for further therapy of her idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy and for transplant evaluation .
Patient &apos;s past medical history is to besummarized as follows :
In 1990 the patient was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Hispit , Delaware</PHI> .
Since that time the patient has been treated medically .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/93 the patient underwent exercise tolerance test which showed a MBO2 of 12.7 mg per kilogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/93 the patient underwent transplant evaluation at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
Echocardiogram showed severe PR and mitral regurgitation , mild AI and ejection fraction of 15% to 20% , a markedly dilated left ventricle and moderately dilated right ventricle , and a question of a possible left ventricular and right ventricular thrombus .
Consequently the patient was started on Coumadin .
Catheterization at that time showed an RA pressure of 60 , cardiac index of 1.7 , SVR of 2100 and a PVR of 387 .
Coronaries were completely normal .
Consequently the patient was admitted to the CCU for intensive hemodynamic monitoring , and after load reduction .
In the CCU the patient was initially treated with nitroprusside and eventually switched to Captopril and Isordil .
Hemodynamics were optimized resulting in a cardiac output of 4.4 with a SVR of 1300 and a wedge of 16 .
Pulmonary function tests were obtained which showed marked pulmonary dysfunction with FEV1 of 1.4 and markedly decreased ELCL of 50% .
Repeat pulmonary function tests following optimization of cardiac therapy showed somewhat improved but not to a significant degree of the pulmonary function tests .
Furthermore , due to the patient &apos;s long standing amiodarone therapy , and a positive second pulmonary function , Amiodarone was discontinued during that hospital admission .
Consequently the patient was discharged on Captopril , Digoxin , Lasix , Micronase , Isordil and prn inhalers .
The patient did well at home until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/31</PHI>/94 when she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Souland</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Nixmont Bovo</PHI> with increasing congestive heart failure .
At that time the patient was aggressively diuresed .
By report , in the interim since discharge from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> , amiodarone was restarted for unclear indications .
Dring this hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Hahkellrick Hospital</PHI> , a dobutamine drip was started to improve hemodynamics , and in the setting of the dobutamine drip the patient had spontaneous ventricular tachycardia / ventricular fibrillation arrest .
She was quickly defibrillated and converted to sinus rhythm with a left bundle branch block .
She was treated for a short time with Lidocaine and eventually weaned off .
She was continued on low dose dobutamine and transferred back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI>/94 , again for possible heart-lung transplantation .
The patient was evaluated by the CHF and Heart Transplant Service .
It was felt that the patient was not likely a good transplant candidate secondary to endocurrent lung disease .
Furthermore , since it was felt that the patient failed amiodarone therapy , the patient was seen by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alllo Eino Hospital</PHI> which recommended EPS to rule out possible bundle branch reentry as the source of the patient &apos;s arrhythmia with possible AICD placement if the EPS was negative .
Note , per recommendation from the CHF Team , dobutamine was discontinued within the first 24 hours of the patient &apos;s hospitalization without difficulty .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI>/94 an EPS study was performed .
The patient was negative for inducible ventricular arrhythmias despite maximal stimulation .
Consequently AICD placement was recommended .
Consequently , the patient underwent AICD placement on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 .
Note , from <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/22</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI> there is a question of the patient having a right forearm thrombophlebitis .
Consequently , the patient underwent a full 2 week course of antibiotic therapy along with debridement of the right forearm for placement of the AICD .
Note , biopsies from the right forearm were significant only for inflammation , and not infection .
Cultures were negative , and note , no pus or purulent fluid was found upon debridement .
Thus , AICD placement was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/09</PHI>/94 following a 2 week course of antibiotic therapy for presumed ( but later found to be inflammation only ) of right forearm phlebitis .
There were no intraoperative or postoperative complications following the AICD placement .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/10</PHI>/94 the patient was able to ambulate without assistance , and was only having minimal tenderness at the AICD placement site .
At this point it was felt the patient would go home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/13</PHI>/94 .
It was felt that the patient should stay inhouse over the weekend since the patient will be traveling back to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Vonamemp , LA</PHI> via plane by herself .
This was discussed with both the patient and the Cardiology B Team .

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/15</PHI>/1998
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">09/23</PHI>/98
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Wolfe-Parkinson White Syndrome .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .
His cardiac risk factors include :
hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
He has a history of chest pain and in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .
He subsequently had an echocardiogram in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .
He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .
He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .
He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Slusslashgodle</PHI> which were unsuccessful .
He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/2</PHI>/98 he was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Cay Memorial Hospital Of</PHI> with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .
He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .
An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .
He was discharged home but returned on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/13</PHI>/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .
He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .
He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> for further evaluation and management .
Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Sotalol 160 mg bid .
Atenolol 25 mg bid .
Prilosec 20 mg qd .
Propulsid 10 mg qd .
NPH and CZI insulin .
Resulin 400 mg qd .
Lisinopril 10 mg bid .
Aspirin .
Lasix 60 mg qd .
ALLERGIES :
He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .
There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .
However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .
PHYSICAL EXAM :
He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .
His lungs were clear throughout .
His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .
There was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .
Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .
His abdomen was benign .
Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .
LABORATORY DATA :
BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .
His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .
His hematocrit was 49.3 .
His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .
There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .
Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .
His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .
He was seen by <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nnoatal Hospital Center</PHI> who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .
Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/17</PHI>/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .
His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .
He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .
His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .
The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/20</PHI>/98 .
There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .
Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .
Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .
There were no complications .
Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .
He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .
In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .
There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .
He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .
Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .
His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .
After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .
His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .
Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .
Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .
He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .
Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .
Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/23</PHI>/98 .
He will have a visiting nurse to see him on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Iat</PHI> .
FOLLOW-UP :
He will follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Taarnna Service</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> as well as Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lupevickette Folk</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Dwainco Rallsversgach</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Villean Garl</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :

Patient initially presented in 1991 with cervical lymphadenopathy , was treated with MACE / CytaBOM , and did well until 1997 , when he received six cycles of fludarabine for progressive disease .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> , 2001 , he progressed to leukemic phase , received Rituxan and CVP .
Started Campath in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> , 2001 , complicated by lymphopenia / neutropenia and CMV infection , and underwent MUD stem cell transplant in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 2002 .
The patient had bone marrow biopsy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> , 2003 , for persistent pancytopenia , revealing mild hypercelluarity with 80% leukemic cells .
He was again treated with Campath , had recurrent fever in association with sinus symptoms , with CT scan showing left maxillary sinusitis in association with new skin nodules on right elbow and buttocks .
Patient was hospitalized <PHI TYPE="DATE">September 26</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 11</PHI> for what was diagnosed by skin biopsy and sinus washings as Acanthamoeba infection of skin and sinuses , without any progression to neurologic infection ( as assessed by head CT and MRI ) .
ID consult was obtained and he was initially treated with azithromycin , itraconazole , and pentamidine , with progression of skin infection .
Subsequent discontinuance of azithromycin , trial of 5-FC , with increasing neutropenia requiring discontinuance , change if itraconazole to voriconazole , given continued neutropenia , and trial of sulfadiazine , discontinued for increasing ARS .
Patient was maintained on p.o. voriconazole and IV pentamidine , with pentamidine nasal washings , with re-CT of sinuses near end of stay showing no change in disease burden .
He has had recurrent CMB infection in the setting of Campath therapy , requiring IV Foscarnet therapy during stay , with inability to tolerate valganciclovir maintenance suppression subsequently due to increasing ARS .
Hypercapture near end of stay was negative .
Patient experienced acute renal failure on chronic renal insufficiency , with previous baseline creatinine 1.6 , felt to be due to medication toxicity , requiring Kayexalate and Phoslo to manage electrolytes , but never any need for hemodialysis , with mild improvement of creatinine by discharge , with peak creatinine 3.4 , discharge creatinine 2.6 .
Patient struggled with GVHD , with extensive skin involvement , taking Cellcept , prednisone and cyclosporine at time of last admission .
Cellcept was discontinued in the setting of infection , but attempts to decrease prednisone or cyclosporine were unsuccessful .
Patient returns from rehabilitation after discharge on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 11</PHI> , with new fever up to 102.0 in DSCI clinic , increasing hepatomegaly as assessed by examination in clinic , and increasing creatinine .
Patient reports no significant changes in how he feels over the past week .

Sodium 129 , creatinine 3.0 , BUN 70 , potassium 5.0 , bicarbonate 23 , chloride 99 , ALT 36 , AST 30 , alkaline phosphatase 215 , total bilirubin 1.1 , albumin 2.6 , white blood cell count 2.0 , hematocrit 30.5 , platelets 60 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient was admitted for diagnosis and treatment of new fever .
Workup on admission included a chest x-ray negative for pneumonia , an MRI of the liver to investigate for focal lesion , with no evidence for abscess or focal lesion on report .
Blood and urine cultures with only positive culture a blood culture on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> , with one of two bottles positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
A repeat CMV hypercapture , negative for presence of CMV .
A repeat CAT scan of the sinuses with finding of progressive thickening of the left maxillary sinus and both sets of ethmoid air cells since prior study of <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 9</PHI> , indicating progressive infection of Acanthamoeba and any possible superinfection with bacterial sinusitis .
In the days following admission , there was clear evidence for progression of erythematous nodules over both arms and right thigh at foci of Acanthamoeba infection , suggesting progressive skin involvement with Acanthamoeba .
Infectious disease consult was obtained and recommendation was to switch from voriconazole to itraconazole , on which there was more existing data on treatment of Acanthamoeba infection .
Pentamidine intravenous and nasal washings were continued .
Clinical progression of skin and sinus infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy continued , with emergence on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> of a new right-sided ptosis in association with a left homonymous hemianopsia , and fleeting confusion while febrile , prompting head MRI which revealed a large 5 x 2 x 4.3 cm region in the right occipital lobe of hemorrhage and edema , with dural and , likely , leptomeningeal enhancement in association with small foci in the right cerebellum and pons , concerning for early lesions of similar type .
Idiosyncratic reaction to cyclosporine was considered as cause for cerebritis , and cyclosporine was discontinued .
However , much more likely explanation is progressive infection of Acanthamoeba with new neurologic involvement .
Most likely source of fevers was judged to be progressive Acanthamoeba infection , even on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
A single blood culture positive for coagulase negative Staphylococcus was treated with a course of vancomycin in the setting of a PICC line and a chest x-ray on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 20</PHI> indicating possible developing pneumonia , resulted in a course of levofloxacin , for both possible pneumonia , as well as treatment of any bacterial superinfection of Acanthamoeba sinusitis .
Patient experienced steady decline , with persistent fevers despite all above measures , progressive areas of skin infection , more frequent episodes of confusion , and decreasing oxygen saturation in the setting of bilateral effusion , in the setting of fluid surge spacing .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 30</PHI> , a family meeting with patient &apos;s daughter and spouse , along with primary oncologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tomedankell Bile</PHI> , attending physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Mellerny Close</PHI> , and house staff , was held to discuss patient &apos;s critical condition and inability to prevent progression of skin , sinus and neurological Acanthamoeba infection on maximal antimicrobial therapy .
Decision was made to withdraw aggressive measures of care , with priority on patient &apos;s comfort .
Pentamidine , itraconazole , Levaquin , acyclovir and GCSF were discontinued , along with other medications nonessential to patient &apos;s comfort .
DNR / DNI status initially established early during hospital stay remained in effect .
The patient was made comfortable with morphine for pain and for air hunger , and sinus suctioning was continued to relieve congestion , in conjunction with continuation of nasal sprays .
Tylenol was continued to control fevers and prednisone was continued to control inflammation and prevent precipitation of adrenal insufficiency .
Such measures have been continued through <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 3</PHI> , and patient remains comfortable through this time .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
EPIGLOTTITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is an 87 year old white female who is otherwise healthy by history and presented with a several day history of upper respiratory infection .
Of note , the patient does not smoke and does not drink .
She was seen by her local internist after having several days of blood-tinged sputum which she was coughing up and some mild throat discomfort .
She did not complain of significant pain and was able to tolerate p.o.s.
She denied any respiratory distress although her family thought she may have had some labored breathing at one point .
She was seen by her local physician who was concerned that she may have a malignancy secondary to the history of hemoptysis and throat discomfort .
He recommended that she see a local otolaryngologist .
Examination by the local otolaryngologist appareantly revealed significant swelling in the epiglottic area although we had no true record of what was seen .
There was also a question of a carcinomatous lesion on the left side of the epiglottis .
Apparently the findings were significant enough to cause this otolaryngologist to recommend that the family bring the patient emergently to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ez Ephtro Health Center</PHI> where she be admitted for steroids and antibiotics and apparently the question of a tracheostomy was raised .
The patient &apos;s granddaughter , however , works at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> and therefore the family elected to bring the patient home and then bring her to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> .
She presented to the Emergency Room with some throat discomfort , some mild hoarseness , which she said had been progressing over the last few days .
She was sitting straight upright although was not having any respiratory distress .
She did report a lot of salive in the back of her throat .
She was febrile to 101.7 .
ENT consult was obtained .
A lateral neck film revealed significant swelling of the epiglottis .
ENT examination was then to be performed .
Chest x-ray showed significant kiphosis but otherwise no significant lesions at all .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Negative .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
None .
ALLERGIES :
None .
Smoking none .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Negative .
Alcohol none .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Lives in an old age facility but is quite active and quite independent .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was sitting upright and was not drooling and was able to swallow her secretions although she did have a very wet voice which got progressively more hoarse during the examination .
She had no respiratory distress but did choose to sit in an upright position .
Her ear examination was normal .
Nasal examination was normal .
Oral cavity was normal .
Neck :
Revealed fullness in the submental and suprahyoid regions with mild tenderness which was consistent with edema of the soft tissues without significant mass .
Neck :
Otherwise normal and the trachea was midline .
Hypopharyngeal examiantion revealed a severely edematous , yellowish-white epiglottis with significantly edematous base of tongue which had marked watery edema .
The left pyriform was obliterated by edema .
The right pyriform was narrowed by edema .
The epiglottis was so edematous that is was pushed back posteriorly and abutted the posterior oropharynx completely obscuring the larynx .
The patient had no stridor and it was clear that she must be breathing around the epiglottis .
There was blood oozing out from the left lateral epiglottis at the region consistent with its base although this was unclear for identification secondary to edema and it was possible that she may have had a lesion in this area .
Lungs :
Clear .
Heart :
Regular rate and rhythm .
S1 and S2 , no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , positive bowel sounds , no hepatosplenomegaly , no bruits .
No masses .
Extremities :
Normal .
Back :
Showed significant thoracic kiphosis .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Revealed a WBC count of 11.6 , H and H of 10.7 and 31.7 , platelet count of 268 , differential 94 polys , 0 bands , 5 lymphs , one mono .
As noted above , lateral neck film revealed marked edema of the epiglottis .
The chest x-ray showed signficant kiphosis with several areas of increased interstitial markings but otherwise negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was felt to have epiglottitis , possibly secondary to a malignancy , especially in her age group .
She was started on IV Ceftriaxone two grams and was given humidification .
Due to the marked amount of edema , it was felt that she should go the Operating Room emergently for elective intubation .
She was taken to the Operating Room at approximately 2:00 a.m. which was approximately one hour after being evaluated by ENT and was intubated awake over a fiberoptic bronchoscope through the left nares with nasal anesthetic only with a #6 endotracheal tube .
The patient was sedated .
Direct laryngoscopy was performed but this revealed only a large amount of base of tongue edema with minimally visible epiglottis which was also significantly edematous and no distinct mass or lesion could be noted .
She was transferred to the SICU where she was kept sedated and was given Ceftriaxone one gram q. 12 h. as well as IV steroids for the first 24 hours consisting of Decadron 8 mg q. 8 h. X 3 doses in addition to 10 mg that she received in the Emergency Room on the way down to the Operating Room .
Her initial hospital course while intubated was significant for an episode of atrial fibrillation which she went into in the Operating Room .
At the end of the case she had had a central line placed also for frequent blood draws at the request of the SICU house office .
Her episode of atrial fibrillation as we planned to take her from the Operating Room after both the intubation and central line placement had been completed .
She had no trouble with blood pressure with this atrial fibrillation with rates going up to 150 .
She was given a dose of Digoxin but broke spontaneously approximately two minutes after the Digoxin was given .
EKG and enzymes were obtained and showed the first degree AV block that she had had on her preoperative EKG but no other findings at all .
She continued in normal sinus rhythm and was transferred to the ICU where she was monitored .
Her blood gases and O2 saturations correlated well and we used O2 saturations to follow her as well as venous gases and she continued to maintain good O2 saturation .
She was kept ventilated because she was kept sedated .
She went into an SVT the afternoon after intubation and a decision was made to Digitalize her , keeping her level between approximately .6 and 1 .
She continued in sinus rhythm after this episode of SVT and again had no problems with her blood pressure during that .
Her edema decreased over the next two days and repeat fiberoptic examination on both <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI> revealed decreasing edema .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 in the ICU under controlled conditions , she was electively extubated and had no problems .
She was kept on Ceftriaxone but no further steroids were given .
Examination at that time revealed question of a lesion at the left lateral glossoepiglottic fold .
Otherwise her examination was normal with good visualization of the larynx and significant decrease in size of the epiglottis .
Of note , during her first hospital day when she received steroids her blood sugars did increase significantly and therefore she was started on insulin .
Once the steroids were stopped , the insulin was able to be stopped .
Tube feedings were started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/3</PHI>/91 and the NG tube was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/5</PHI>/91 prior to extubation to give a better look at the epiglottis prior to extubating her .
After extubation she was watched in the ICU for 24 hours and she did well except for some episodes of confusion happening the night of extubation and also the next morning .
Again , MI was ruled out and metabolic tests were within normal limits .
O2 saturations looked good .
It was felt that this was a mild episode of ICU psychosis .
She was followed on the regular floor 24 hours after extubation and had no further problems with her airway .
She was maintained on Ceftriaxone and then switched to Augmentin and remained afebrile .
Her white counts came down .
Blood cultures which had been drawn at the time of intubation were negative .
She had a geriatric consult due to her confusion and they suggested as we had already done to stop all sedatives and sleeping medications .
Cardiology was contacted and recommended that given her history she should be taken off all Digoxin and just watched and that her SVTs may have been just secondary to stress of intubation .
Unfortunately the episodes of atrial fibrillation and SVT were apparently not documented well enough in terms of EKG strips to aid Cardiology and therefore , they gave us an informal consult so that no formal consult will be found in this chart .
Nonetheless , their input was greatly appreciated and she was taken off of Digoxin and had no further problems with her heart .
Her mental status began to clear under the family &apos;s request .
DISPOSITION :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/9</PHI>/91 she was sent home on a week of Augmentin and will followup in the ENT Clinic .
Our plan will be to establish whether or not she truly had an epiglottic lesion .
She , of note , had no history of foreign body ingestion or any abrasion or trauma to this area .
If she does have a lesion , then we may entertain , given her age , the possibility of radiating this lesion as opposed to putting her through laryngectomy .
Discharge medications are Augmentin 500 mg t.i.d. X 7 days .
The patient is to followup in the ENT Clinic in approximately one week .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
EPIGLOTTITIS , QUESTION SECONDARY TO EPIGLOTTIC MALIGNANCY .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Cholangiocarcinoma , recurrent ; status post radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
1) Obstructive jaundice , secondary to recurrent tumor and / or stricture at the bile duct to jejunum anastomosis .
2) Subhepatic fluid collection , drained .
3) Clostridium difficile colitis with diarrhea .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , replacement of permanent biliary stents and liver biopsy .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/24</PHI>/95 , percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/27</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/30</PHI>/95 , <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 , and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 there were revisions and contrast injections to the biliary catheter drainage system .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 55-year-old man who is status post resection of a Klatskin tumor , who returns with persistent jaundice and right upper quadrant pain .
The present illness is marked by presentation with jaundice and pain in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of 1994 , and a computerized tomography scan that showed bile duct dilatation .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> 1994 , he had an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography that shoed obstruction at the confluence of the left and right hepatic ducts .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1994 , the Klatskin tumor was resected and it was shown to be moderately differentiated cholangiocarcinoma .
The surgical margins were positive and he was treated postoperatively with radiation therapy and chemotherapy .
He was admitted in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> 1994 , for biliary drainage catheter placement and balloon dilatation of what was thought to be an anastomotic stricture .
Biopsies and fine needle aspirates were suspicious for recurrent cholangiocarcinoma .
Since that time he had been persistently jaundiced and fatigued , until three weeks prior to admission when the patient had a biliary tube check , which showed things to be patent despite his rising bilirubin .
He presented now for evaluation of failed biliary drainage .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination , he had a normal temperature and blood pressure .
His lungs were clear .
His head and neck showed marked scleral icterus and a cardiac examination showed a systolic ejection murmur .
The abdomen was soft and had well healed right upper quadrant scar .
The extremities were unremarkable .
Rectal examination was negative and his neurological examination was intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
His hematocrit was 25.8% , with a normal white blood cell count .
His bilirubin was total 11.1 , with a direct bilirubin of 10.2 and his alkaline phosphatase was 2,188 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and started on intravenous antibiotics and studied with an abdominal computerized tomography scan .
The computerized tomography scan showed dilated left and right hepatic ducts and was consistent with some form of blockage of the drainage arrangement .
What then ensued was multiple attempts to insure adequate biliary decompression by use of percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram and placement of biliary catheters and stents .
The procedures took place on several days throughout the hospital stay with the sentinel pro cedure taking place on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/95 , and this was placement of the 10 mm diameter metal wallstents .
Subsequent to that , he was found to have a subhepatic fluid collection , which was suspicious for a bile leak and therefore a drain was placed percutaneously into this collection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/95 and <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , very mild revisions were made of these and the feeling was that solution had been reached with good drainage .
His bilirubin by the time of discharge had fallen from a peak of 28 down to a discharge value of 8 .
He was feeling much better , taking good diet and denying pain or fever .
During the course of the hospitalization , he was found to have diarrhea and stool was sent and found to be positive for Clostridium difficile toxin and this initiated treatment with Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for two weeks .
He was covered prophylactically for the indwelling stents with ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d.
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/04</PHI>/95 , it was deemed he was ready for discharge and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Blinjesc</PHI> discharged him to the care of his primary physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> , in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Taette</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ma</PHI> will be working with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Besti Kotebreun</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> to manage the currently indwelling stents .
The patient will continue his course of Flagyl until that is finished and he will stay on the po ofloxacin until the external draining stents are removed .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF DISCHARGE :
are Glyburide 5-15 mg po q a.m. and 0-10 mg po q p.m. , depending on amount of oral intake ; Celesone 1 1/2 tablets po q day , Tagamet 400 mg PO b.i.d. , ofloxacin 400 mg PO b.i.d. , CZI sliding scale which will not be continued on discharge , and Flagyl 500 mg PO t.i.d. for a total of fourteen days .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
1. Primary central nervous system lymphoma .
2. Pancytopenia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 74 year old right hand dominant white female with a history of primary central nervous system lymphoma , diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> , 1994 , status post twelve cycles of high dose methotrexate , status post two cycles of high dose ARA-C chemotherapy , who was admitted with a chief complaint of rectal bleeding and decreasing platelet count .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 1994 patient developed 2-3 months of headaches , cognitive changes , dizziness and memory loss .
An MRI showed enhancing white marrow lesions at the bifrontal lobes on the right side , and rightsided basal ganglion in the right cerebral peduncle .
The patient underwent a biopsy which showed a primary CNS lymphoma .
The patient was initially treated with high-dose methotrexate for six cycles .
However , the patient developed left IIIrd nerve palsy and an MRI showed increasing lesion in the left ______________ cerebral peduncle and the left mid brain .
The patient was reinduced with high dose methotrexate , 8 mg / meter sq. with some initial tumor response .
However , when the patient was started on 3.5 gm / meter sq. maintenance dose , the tumor progressed .
At that point , the patient was switched over toe high-dose ARA-C ( 2.5 gm / meter sq ) .
On the high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy , the patient developed bone marrow suppression requiring intermittent Neupogen ( GCSF ) support .
The patient was recently discharged from the hospital after her second cycle of high-dose ARA-C chemotherapy .
The patient remained stable to the last few days prior to admission when she developed insidious rectal bleeding , probably from her external hemorrhoids , along with decreasing platelet count .
On the day of admission the patient &apos;s platelet count dropped to 28,000 and the patient was admitted for her platelet transfusions and further work up for her rectal bleeding .
The patient complained of chronic constipation and rectal bleeding after each bowel movement .

white blood count 5,000 , hematocrit 38 , platelet count 50,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 26</PHI> , white blood count 2.5 , hematocrit 29 , platelet count 32,000 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 27</PHI> , white blood count 1.6 , hematocrit 28.9 , platelet count 28,000 :
66 polys , 8 bands with ANC of 1056 .
Sodium 136 , potassium 3.3 , chloride 103 , bicarb 26 , BUN 24 , creatinine 0.7 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient developed substernal chest pain without radiation on the night of admission .
An electrocardiogram showed flat ST change in lead III , otherwise unremarkable and the patient was given sublingual nitroglycerin without symptomatic improvement .
The patient was given 2 units of packed RBC along with the six units of platelet transfusion .
The patient &apos;s symptoms improved with the above measures and the patient no longer complained of chest pain during the hospitalization .
The patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 76,000 on the following morning ; however , her white blood count dropped to 900 with 58 polys with 8 bands .
Because of significant neutropenia , the patient was put on reverse isolation and started on GCSF injections .
The patient &apos;s white blood count improved with the GCSF and her counts went up to 18.2 on the day of discharge .
The patient &apos;s hemoglobin improved to 10.0 after the transfusion and her rectal bleeding apparently stopped .
A GI consultation was made and they felt that the rectal bleeding is most likely from the hemorrhoids and no further intervention was felt to be necessary .
After the transfusion the patient &apos;s platelet count improved to 101,000 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 2</PHI> .
The patient had a follow up MRI scan which showed no significant change of tumor mass .
However , in lieu of a persistent bone marrow suppression from chemotherapy , it was decided that she should undergo radiation therapy .
The patient was assimilated on the day of discharge and the patient will be started on radiation therapy in a few days .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Decadron 6 mg po tid ; and she should continue Inderal , Synthroid and Zoloft at the present dose and frequency .
The patient was instructed to call us with any clinical or neurological symptoms .
The patient will have a follow up complete blood count with differential on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI>

Placement of chest tube for bleomycin sclerotherapy , <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/20</PHI>/94 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient was a 68 year old female who presented to the emergency room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/22</PHI> with a chief complaint of increasing dyspnea .
She had a long history of significant and complex medical issues .
She had a long history of smoking and fairly severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
In addition , she had insulin dependent diabetes mellitus as well as a recent myocardial infarction in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> of 1994 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/20</PHI> she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Secla Berl Spo Hospital</PHI> with a chief complaint of chest discomfort and dyspnea .
She presented with wide complex tachycardia and congestive heart failure .
She eventually ruled in for a myocardial infarction and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/21</PHI> .
Following her hospitalization at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Etearal Etsystems/ Hospital</PHI> he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Louline Mauikings Medical Center</PHI> , where she had a protracted hospitalization during which she was treated for congestive heart failure , gastrointestinal bleeding , and uncontrolled atrial flutter rates .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , she was an elderly female in moderate respiratory distress , blood pressure 100/60 , respirations 26 , pulse 68 , temperature afebrile .
Her jugular venous pressure was within normal limits .
Arterial pulse contours were diminished bilaterally .
S1 and S2 were markedly diminished .
A soft systolic ejection murmur was audible at the base .
A soft Grade I-II / VI holosystolic murmur was evident at the apex .
No S3 was present .
Breath sounds were markedly diminished on the right ; crackles were present on the left , approximately 1/3 up .
The abdomen was soft and non-tender with normal bowel sounds present and no pulsatile masses evident .
The lower extremity pulses were diminished .
There was 2+ lower extremity edema evident .
No grossly evident focal neurological findings were noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Crestwall Hospital</PHI> , where a therapeutic thoracentesis was performed in order to alleviate her dyspnea .
Cytology was positive for moderate to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma .
A chest CT on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/24</PHI> demonstrated a right lower lobe mass as well as significant mediastinal lymphadenopathy .
A cardiac ultrasound study on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Memorial Day</PHI> demonstrated an aortic stenosis with a calculated valve area of .6 square cm .
Following an episode of mild rightsided weakness associated with slurring of speech on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/06</PHI> , a brain MRI was obtained .
An enhancing focus in the left thalamus was thought to represent a subacute infarct .
In addition an old cerebellar focal infarct was noted , although metastasis could not be completely excluded .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Margmimaui Jesclinke</PHI> was consulted and helped significantly with the day to day management of the patient &apos;s COPD and frequent desaturations in the setting of a large , recurrent right pleural effusion .
During the course of the last 4-5 days the patient &apos;s condition deteriorated substantially .
After extensive consultation with her family and with the patient herself , it was decided that her status should be made DNR .
This was completely consonant with her wishes and her family &apos;s wishes as well .
Over the weekend of <PHI TYPE="DATE">06/30</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/01</PHI> , her condition further deteriorated , and she was started on a morphine drip .
She did not respond to intravenous diuretics or renal dose dopamine .
We insured that she was comfortable until she expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">07/02</PHI>/94 .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cean Leach</PHI> is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Ville , Virginia</PHI> for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .
He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l988 .
He was treated at that time with TPA .
A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .
His ejection fraction was in the mid-50&apos;s.
Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .
He did well until he developed recurrent angina in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .
He again did well until approximately late l992 .
Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with recurrent chest pain .
He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .
He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40&apos;s and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">August</PHI> of l994 at 31% .
He was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">George&apos;sdgot Medical Center</PHI> with a typical episode of this discomfort in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
He was transferred at that time to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> .
That was his first <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> admission .
Because of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .
His angiograms from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .
He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 13</PHI> , 1994 .
There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .
Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .
He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .
Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .
Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .
He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .
However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .
It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .
He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .
Following that admission in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .
Starting in the <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .
This occurred at rest and with exercise .
He had multiple admissions to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .
His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .
His most recent admission to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Morehegron Valley Hospital</PHI> is on <PHI TYPE="DATE">April 5</PHI> , of 1994 .
He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .
Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-9</PHI>-94 .
His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .
There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .
Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20&apos;s .
There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .
Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .
His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He looked generally well .
His blood pressure l60/90 .
His heart rate was 88 .
His jugular venous pressure was normal .
His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .
His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .
His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .
He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .
His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .
Potassium of 3.2 .
Normal chloride and CO2 .
His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .
Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .
His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .
His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .
His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .
His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
the primary concern upon Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .
It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .
To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4-10</PHI>-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .
The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .
The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .
Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> of l994 .
That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .
Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .
Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .
He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lato Tikfreierm</PHI> of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .
After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .
Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .
This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s regiment .
Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.
Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> &apos;s platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .
These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .
There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .
Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .
Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .
He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .
He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .
Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .
The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .
Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .
Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .
Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .
Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .
It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .
His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .
His APC resistance was normal .
He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .
Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .
He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .
It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .
His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .
Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .
To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .
Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 13</PHI> .
That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .
On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .
That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .
This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .
He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .
He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .
This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .
After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Leach</PHI> was brought back down to the pain clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> .
There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .
Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .
The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .
After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 27</PHI> , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Aalv Sctroi</PHI> .
He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .
He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on <PHI TYPE="DATE">May 27</PHI> , 1995 .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Ticlopodine 500 mg. p.o.b.i.d. Lovastatin 20 mg. p.o.q.d. Lasix 80 mg. q.d. Kayciel 60 meq b.i.d. Cimetidine 400 mg. b.i.d. Isordil 20 mg. t.i.d. and Lodopine 10 mg. q.d. a combination of Percocet , Morphine Sulfate elixir p.o. as needed .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8-20</PHI>-91 at which time a total knee repair was done to both the right and left knees .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and returned to his room on postoperative day one .
The patient did , on , postoperative day one have a bout of grossly heme positive emesis .
He stated at this point that he did have a history of peptic ulcer disease and he did have a slow and continuous drop in his hematocrit until approximately postoperative day three .
The patient also had episodes of significant temperature spikes sometimes to 102.6 .
The patient was cultured multiple times , blood cultures , urine cultures and sputum cultures , all which were negative ( as well as chest x-ray ) .
The temperature spikes did continue but have reached to a degree no higher than 100 degrees Farenheit and occurred a significantly decreased number of times .
In terms of knee function , the patient has progressed very well and is ambulating approximately 12 feet on his own at this point .
In terms of followup care , I would suggest that the patient have a gastroenterologist consult upon completion of Rehab and for further workup of his grossly heme positive emesis , with possible guaiac positive stool searching for a source of a bleed .

Report Status :
Unsigned
ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/16</PHI>/94
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02/28</PHI>/94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Thoracoabdominal aneurysm .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
Hypertension .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">2/17</PHI>/94 :
resection and grafting of thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm .
HISTORY :
The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18</PHI>/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .
At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .
She was subsequently referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .
The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/31</PHI>/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .
The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .
Since the patient &apos;s last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .
Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .
Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .
She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .
Extremities :
are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .
She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .
Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .
EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .
Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .
There were no intraoperative complications .
She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
The patient &apos;s procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .
The patient remained intubated postoperatively .
She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .
On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .
Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .
The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .
Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .
The patient &apos;s oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .
She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .
This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .
Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .
Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .
Neurological consultation was obtained .
It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .
The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .
MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .
The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .
She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .
Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .
Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .
Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .
The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .
The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .
The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .
She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .
Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center</PHI> .
It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Is satisfactory .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
(1) status post thoracoabdominal aneurysm grafting and resection .
COMPLICATIONS :
During this hospitalization include left lower extremity paresis as well as E. coli urinary tract infection .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Lopressor 25 mg PO b.i.d. , Dulcolax tablets 2 PO q.a.m. , Dulcolax suppository 1 PO q.o.d. , digoxin .125 mg PO q. day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. , Tylenol 650 mg PO / PR q. 4 hours p.r.n. elevated temperature , Benadryl 25-50 PO q.h.s. and Percocet 1-2 tablets PO q. 4 hours p.r.n. pain .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Zetllille</PHI> and she is to maintain rehabilitation care at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Laelk Memorial Hospital</PHI> .

Documented .
Diarrhea responded initially to Paromomicin , but subsequent medical compliance was poor .
4. Cerebral toxoplasmosis , stable , on suppressive therapy .
5. History of Cryptococcosis .
Titer :
1024 , in <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/91 , cerebrospinal fluid was negative .
Titer stable at 1:8 on suppressive therapy .
6. Cytomegalovirus-positive , no history of cytomegalovirus disease .
7. Weight loss , presumably secondary to Cryptococcosis , and AIDS .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Very cachectic , malnourished young man , with extensive oral and facial Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma .
Temperature was 98.8 , blood pressure was 114/70 , heart rate was 72 , respirations were 18 .
Skin :
Scattered Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma , several necrotic lesions , right lower extremity , consistent with chronic ulcers .
His head , eyes , ears , nose , throat :
Fundi were normal , eomi , pupils equal , round , reactive to light .
Prominent hard right upper cervical lymph node .
Chest was clear .
Cor :
No murmur .
Abdomen was soft and nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , guaiac positive ( oral bleeding from Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma ) .
GU was normal .
Extremities :
No edema .
Neurologic :
Question left facial weakness , otherwise nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium was 130 , potassium was 2.0 , phosphorus was 1.8 , magnesium was 1.0 , SGOT was 41 , hematocrit was 34.6 , white blood count was 3.4 , platelet count was 134,000 , chest X-ray was clear .
Head CAT-scan :
No progression of toxoplasmosis , multiple abnormalities consistent with PML .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Malnutrition / cachexia/diarrhea / Cryptosporidiosis .
The patient was treated with PPN and elemental diet , for correction of metabolic disturbances , improved fluid balance , and nutritional support .
Paromomycin was continued until his supply was used up , and charithromycin was continued .
AZT was initiated .
Stool was negative for Cryptosporidium .
His diarrhea diminished .
He developed urinary retention and abdominal pain , which resolved with discontinuation of Lomotil .
However , KUB showed persistent change , consistent with ileus or early partial small bowel obstruction .
As he improved symptomatically and was able to take po without discomfort , it was decided to follow him clinically .
On this admission and on previous outpatient laboratory data , potassium and phosphorus tended to be very low so Neutra-Phos K was continued at discharge .
Lomotil was held at discharge because of question of ileus , but may be reinstituted at a very low dose , for example , 1-2 per day .
2. Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma :
Coincident with peripheral parenteral nutrition , the patient developed severe facial swelling , as well as an extreme increase in Kaposi &apos;s sarcoma lesions , with almost total engulfing of his teeth .
He was treated with Vincristine , followed several days later by Bleomycin , with return of his condition to somewhat better than baseline on admission .
It was planned to give him one more dose of Vincristine prior to discharge .
3. Pancytopenia :
There was a decrease in CBC , which was ascribed to AZT , which was discontinued .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSES :
SYNCOPE .
HYPERTENSION .
INDUCIBLE COMPLETE HEART BLOCK .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 81 year old woman with a history of hypertension , history of recurrent VPBs , admitted for investigation following a syncopal episode two weeks prior to admission .
The patient experienced a brief episode of loss of consciousness while driving her car two weeks prior to admission , at which time she collided with the car in front of her and rapidly regained consciousness .
There was no aura , no witnessed seizure activity and no post ictal symptoms .
The patient has a history of ventricular premature beats for which she was treated with Flecainide .
After the syncopal episode the patient was evaluated at a local hospital with head and abdominal CT , EEG , and EKG , all of which were normal .
Her Flecainide was discontinued and she was referred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">CTMC</PHI> for further evaluation .
The patient has history of VPBs as noted above , treated with Flecainide with good symptomatic response .
Following discontinuation of this drug the patient noted return of palpitations .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Left mastectomy in 1982 for breast carcinoma .
History of upper GI bleeding in 1985 while on nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines .
DJD , hypertension , status post cholecystectomy , status post cataract surgery , status post herniorrhaphy .
ALLERGIES :
None known .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMIT :
Vaseretic 10 mg p.o.q.d. , Calan SR 240 mg p.o.q.d. , Motrin 600 mg p.o. prn , Cytotec prn with Motrin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
Her husband is in a nursing home .
She is a nonsmoker , nondrinker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Pleasant elderly lady in no apparent distress .
Blood pressure 140/70 , heart rate 84 , with occasional premature beats , respirations 16 , afebrile .
Skin :
Showed bruises over both her knees .
HEENT :
Within normal limits .
Neck :
Supple without lympadenopathy .
No JVD .
Lungs :
Clear .
COR :
Showed no JVD .
Normal S1 and S2 without murmurs .
There was a soft right carotid and right femoral bruit .
Digital pulses were absent bilaterally .
Abdomen :
Soft , nontender , without masses .
Bowel sounds present .
CNS :
Alert and oriented .
Cranial nerves intact .
Sensory motor examination was grossly intact .
Reflexes were normal and symmetric throughout .
Extremities :
Showed nodes in both hands and crepitans of both knees .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Hematocrit 44 , WBC count 4.9 thousand , BUN 15 , creatinine 0.9 thousand , potassium 3.6 , PT and PTT were within normal limits .
LFTs were normal .
Cholesterol 252 .
Chest x-ray normal .
EKG was within normal limits .
UA was normal .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with a history of syncope for cardiac evaluation .
She was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory where a catheterization revealed an 80% mid-RCA stenosis , 80% mid-LAD lesion and an LVEF of approximately 80% .
It was felt that these lesions were unrelated to the patient &apos;s episode , and were unlikely to cause her significant distress .
On the following day , she was taken to electrophysiologic study .
During the study , the right bundle branch was hit by the catheter , inducing a right bundle branch block .
Following this , upon rapid atrial pacing at a rate of 120 , there was revealed a bifascicular left block , which combined with the right bundle branch block caused a complete heart block .
It was felt that given this rate-related block on the left , combined with the possibility of physiologic malfunction on the right , complete heart block as the source of the patient &apos;s syncopal episode was quite possible and plans were made to insert a VVI pacer .
The pacer was inserted on the fifth hospital day without event , and the patient was discharged home on the sixth hospital day .
DISPOSITION :
Calan SR 240 mg p.o. q.d. , Vaseretic 10 mg p.o. q.d. , Ibuprofen and Cytotec prn joint pain .
The patient is discharged home .
Followup with primary physician in one week .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a <PHI TYPE="AGE">111y</PHI> year old female who presented initially to the Medical service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/01</PHI> complaining of weight loss , nausea , vomiting and abdominal distention .
She reported that she was remarkably healthy until the latter part of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/93 , when her granddaughter noticed her to be jaundiced .
Since that time she had yellow colored stools .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/24</PHI> she was taken to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rys Memorial Hospital</PHI> hospital , where she was diagnosed with choledocholithiasis .
An ERCP showed stones in the common bile duct but they could not be recovered .
Therefore she was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> and admitted there from <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/25</PHI> - <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/03</PHI> .
An ERCP was repeated and it was noted that she had a severely dilated common bile duct which contained stones .
The distal portion of the duct was narrowed and a papillotomy was performed , which drained pus from the common bile duct .
The stones were then removed .
The distal narrowing was dilated and cytology was sent , revealing markedly atypical cells with inflammation .
She was discharged home .
Approximately one month prior to admission she developed anorexia , increased abdominal girth , weight loss of 15 lb , and nausea and vomiting .
She presented to the emergency room , where a nasogastric tube was placed and drained approximately 400 of green-brown , thick fluid .
She was admitted for workup of her symptoms .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As above ; appendectomy in 1916 , hysterectomy in 1941 , mastoid surgery in 1970 , shingles of right arm in 1994 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

Sodium 141 , potassium 3.8 , chloride 94 , bicarbonate 31 , BUN 19 , creatinine 1.0 , glucose 218 , alkaline phosphatase 634 , LDH 212 , SGOT 30 , bilirubin 0.8 direct , total bilirubin 1.2 .
Sed rate 100 .
PT 11.8 , PTT 23.9 .
KUB :
Large , approximately 30 cm stomach filled with fluid .
Chest x-ray :
clear lungs .
EKG :
left bundle branch block , left anterior descending , normal sinus rhythm at 90 , non-specific ST-T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital for workup of a presumed obstructive process .
The patient was seen in consultation by the Gastroenterology service and it was decided that an esophagogastroduodenoscopy would be performed .
Prior to this study , however , a CT examination of the abdomen was obtained which showed a mass in the porta causing biliary ductal dilatation proximally and gastric outlet obstruction .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/05</PHI> an esophagogastroduodenoscopy was performed , which showed gastric outlet obstruction , a deformed pylorus and a duodenal mass encasing and obstructing the lumen .
It appeared that there was a large tumor mass obstructing the duodenum and pylorus area , and therefore it was decided that she would benefit from a gastrojejunostomy for drainage of her stomach .
The General Surgery service was involved at this stage , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05/08</PHI> a posterior gastrojejunostomy with wedge liver biopsy was performed to facilitate gastric drainage .
Pathology of the liver biopsy revealed metastatic , moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma .
The patient did well postoperatively and had prompt return of bowel function .
However , on postoperative day #5 it was noticed that she had become acutely jaundiced , and her total bilirubin was found to be 7.2 with a direct bilirubin of 4.9 .
It was obvious that she had now obstructed her biliary tree , as her urine became dark and her stools clay colored .
After discussion with her family , it was decided that a stent would not be placed for biliary decompression and the patient was confirmed as a do not resuscitate status .
The patient &apos;s subsequent hospital course was fairly uneventful .
She complained of fatigue but had a decent appetite .
As she has an obstructing cancer of the biliary tree and further palliative procedures were deferred , her life expectancy is rather limited .
The best course of action was placement in a nursing facility , as her family was unable to care for her at home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Nakoloyd Knutzxelljesc</PHI> is a fifty-one year old female who presented with metastatic lung cancer in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> 1994 .
A work up at that time included a chest X-ray which showed a right hilar mass .
A chest computerized tomography scan showed a right hilar mass , extensive mediastinal adenopathy .
A bone scan showed lesions at T12 and T9 .
Abdominal CT scan showed normal adrenal .
Magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine revealed an erosive lesion at T12 and no cord compression .
A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma .
The patient was entered onto the ICE-T protocol and received three cycles of ICE-T.
After cycle two she had an MRI of the T-spine which showed some improvement in the disease .
After cycle three , she developed severe headache .
An MRI of the central nervous system was done and was unremarkable .
The pain her head became so severe she was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">E Health</PHI> after cycle three with fever , neutropenia , headache , and a cellulitis on the left forearm possibly from an intravenous site .
She was discharged from the hospital on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-04</PHI>-94 with all of her problems under reasonable control except for her severe headache .
She called me on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 5</PHI> , which was one day later , with the headache becoming much worse and becoming disabling .
She , therefore , was admitted for evaluation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The physical examination revealed a middle aged woman with alopecia , and in no acute distress .
The blood pressure was 100/60 , pulse of 70 , respirations of 20 , temperature was 98.6 .
Skin with alopecia , as noted .
HEENT examination was unremarkable .
The neck was supple .
The lungs were clear .
Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs .
Breast exam with status post bilateral implants .
Belly was soft and nontender .
Extremities without edema .
The neurological examination was nonfocal .
LABORATORY DATA :
The white blood count was 9.8 , hematocrit was 29.1 , platelet count was 233,000 .
She had 58% polys , 21% bands , 7% lymphs , 7% monos .
The prothrombin time was 10.6 .
The BUN and creatinine was 13/0.7 , glucose 115 , amylase less than 30 , calcium 9.2 , phosphorus 4.9 , magnesium 1.7 , alkaline phosphatase 302 , SGOT 42 , LDH 360 , CPK 348 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Because of the severe headache , she was seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rashanemar Block</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riord R. Hall</PHI> .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rashanemar Block</PHI> did a lumbar puncture which revealed an opening pressure of 27 , and her cytologies came back positive for adenocarcinoma .
She was seen in consultation by the Pain Service who placed her on a posterior communicating artery pump which helped her dramatically .
In addition , we obtained both cranial and neck MR which showed no evidence of any enhancement or epidural abscess .
When it was found that she had carcinomatous meningitis , she began interthecal methotrexate , given to her every three to four days by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Hall</PHI> .
This was well tolerated .
Her cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained greater than 35 cm of water for the first several days and because of this we decided to place an Ommaya reservoir .
The patient was seen in consultation by Radiation Therapy who did not feel that radiation at this point would offer any advantages .
She had a CSF flow study which showed normal flow CSF throughout her brain .
She had multiple episodes of seizures during the hospitalization and required therapy with Tegretol .
She was given some Mexiletine and Trazodone and did not tolerate that well .
Once she was on good anti-seizure medicine , she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures .
For the last several days of her hospitalization , we switched her over to a Duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of Duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control .
Her headache came under very nice control with aggressive Duragesic patch .
Access became a major problem and we had Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Anruchelle Chaffchird</PHI> from Surgical Oncology place a double Port-a-cath without difficulty .
The plan with <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Knutzxelljesc</PHI> will be to follow her very carefully .
She will be coming back to see us next Tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate .

HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient is a 67-year-old gravida 7 , para 7 white female with metastatic endometrial carcinoma who presented with increasing left lower extremity pain for pain management , anemia , diarrhea .
For her anemia , she received two units of packed red blood cells and tolerated this well .
Hematocrit was 29-30 after her two units of packed red blood cells .
For her increasing left lower extremity pain , she received a pain service consult .
Deep venous thrombosis was ruled out , negative lower extremity noninvasive tests .
The Pain Service started her on MSR Contin and Amitriptyline .
After a few days , she found great relief from her left hip pain .
She still , however , was unable to move it adequately with the aid of Physical Therapy .
She began having some hallucinations which she felt were real .
Psychiatry was consulted and they suggested stopping her Amitriptyline which was done and adding Haldol 1 mg at night and b.i.d. as needed .
Because she had increasing tremors and hallucinations .
Neurology felt that her hallucinations were also most likely due to pain medication and her tremors were enhanced physiological tremor and they suggested trying Mescaline at low doses .
It was felt that the MS Contin should be stopped and that she should be started on a PCA .
She was therefore started on a PCA with constant infusion of 0.3 mg / hour and a rescue dose of 0.1 mg every ten minutes times three doses / hour .
She was also started on Mescaline 60 mg p.o. q. day for her tremor .
Also , while in the hospital , the patient developed a Klebsiella pneumonia UTI for which she received seven days of Ancef because she continues to require an indwelling Foley , she was started on Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day as prophylaxis .
The patient &apos;s cultures from her stool returned positive for C-difficile toxin .
She was , therefore , started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-15</PHI>-91 on Vancomycin 250 mg p.o. q.i.d.
She will continue on this until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-25</PHI>-91 .
Her diarrhea has resolved on this medication .
The patient also underwent chemotherapy treatment during this hospital visit .
She first had a Hickman line placed for chemotherapy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-17</PHI>-92 .
She tolerated this procedure well and the Hickman line has continued to function well .
She had a 24-hour urine which had a creatinine clearance of 57 and a normal RBG with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 63% .
Her chemotherapy was not started until <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-19</PHI>-92 because the treatment had been started for her C-difficile .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">7</PHI>-20 , her diarrhea had resolved and she was started on chemotherapy .
She received Adriamycin 54 mg times two and 200 mg / meter squared of Carbo .
She tolerated this chemotherapy well .
She will get biweekly laboratory results followed .
She also was found to have Candida UTI and was treated for two days with Ampicillin , bladder irritation and follow-up culture was negative .
DISPOSITION :
It was felt that the patient required care facility placement and she will be continued on PCA for her pain management .
Therefore , appropriate chronic care facilities were investigated .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Triacetate 750 mg p.o. t.i.d. ; Atenolol 100 mg p.o. q. day ; Dulcolax one p.o. q. day ; Aquaphor Cream to buttocks p.r.n. ; Senokot one p.o. q. day ; Vancomycin 25 mg p.o. q. 6 hours until 1-20 ; Bactrim double strength one p.o. q. day ; Haldol 1 mg p.o. q. h.s. ; PCA allotted 0.3 mg / hour , rescue dose 0.1 mg every ten minutes three times an hour ; Mysoline 50 mg p.o. q. h.s.

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">02-02</PHI>-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Ependymoma involving the conus medullaris of the spinal cord .
PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> , 1994 , intradural microsurgical exploration and biopsy of invasive intramedullary conus tumor .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient is to rest .
He was given prescriptions for Decadron with a Decadron taper and he was given an out patient appointment to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Niste Addison</PHI> in the Radiation Medicine Service to begin out patient radiotherapy .
He was told to have his sutures removed in seven to ten days , and told to call the office if problems or questions arose .
He was also given a prescription for Percocet as needed for pain .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This twenty-six year old male was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ph University Of Medical Center</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 26</PHI> , 1994 to undergo surgical exploration of a conus tumor .
He had previously been evaluated for back pain and found to have a conus tumor on magnetic resonance imaging study .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Following the standard preoperative evaluation , he was taken to the operating room and underwent a laminectomy T11 , T12 , and L1 and intradural microsurgical exploration .
At the time of surgery we found an invasive conus tumor emanating from the ventral portio of the conus and completely engulfing and encircling all of the ventral nerve roots .
The procedure had been done with intraoperative monitoring , and every time we made an attempt to dissect tumor away from the nerve roots we achieved considerable stimulation of the lower extremity muscles .
We felt that the way the tumor was invading and wrapped around all of the nerves and sharing a common blood supply with them , that it would not be possible to achieve any form of significant surgical decompression or removal of tumor without leading to a substantial neurological deficit .
Therefore , the operation was terminated by placing a large dural graft to provide intradural room with the idea that postoperatively the lesion would be treated with radiation therapy .
The patient tolerated the procedure well .
The postoperative course was without complication .
Pain was managed initially with an intravenous patient controlled analgesia system .
The wound healed without difficulty and the drain was removed .
The patient began to ambulate .
His leg strength was noted to be identical to the way it had been prior to the surgery .
Because of his continued excellent progress , he was allowed to be discharged home on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 2</PHI> , 1994 .

(5) Chemotherapy-related dysuria .
(6) Chemotherapy-related tinnitus .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
REASON FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
<PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Shalyo Kaysplass</PHI> is a 36-year-old male , with metastatic malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone , admitted with shortness of breath , hemoptysis , and hip pain .
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kaysplass</PHI> &apos;s history is well-documented in previous discharge summaries .
Basically , he was diagnosed in 1994 with malignant fibrous histiocytoma of bone in his left hip , underwent multiple cycles of chemotherapy , but was not a candidate for surgical resection and so underwent radiation therapy to the left hip .
He had metastases to the lungs , which responded to more chemotherapy and he underwent autologous bone marrow transplantation in <PHI TYPE="DATE">January</PHI> , 1996 .
For the past six weeks prior to admission , the patient was complaining of worsening right hip pain at the site of a bone marrow biopsy done to evaluate a new pancytopenia .
An magnetic resonance imaging scan showed a mass growing out of the right sacrum , which could have been tumor or a hematoma .
Approximately a week before admission , repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan showed an enlarging soft tissue mass consistent with tumor .
Chest x-ray showed multiple pulmonary nodules , which were thought , given the clinical situation , to be tumor .

The patient has a long history of coronary disease starting in 1946 with his first myocardial infarction .
He underwent a CABG for four vessels in 1980 and did well until 1992 when he began to experience episodic chest pain .
He continued to have episodes of angina for the subsequent several years .
He subsequently went to cath in 1994 which showed a native three vessel disease , patent saphenous vein grafts to his diagonal and to his obtuse marginal and diffusely diseased saphenous vein grafts to his RCA .
He had an echo at this time which showed an ejection fraction of 20% with inferolateral akinesis , septal akinesis and diffuse hypokinesis of the LV .
He had severe mitral regurgitation and moderate tricuspid regurgitation at this time .
He subsequently has been managed at a nursing home medically .
He had been doing fairly well on PO medications and has had intermittent admissions for dobutamine holidays with IV diuresis .
The last of such admissions took place in 1997 in <PHI TYPE="DATE">July</PHI> when he was admitted and placed on dobutamine and diuresed to a dry weight of 115 pounds .
He now presents with at least 10 pound weight gain in spite of doses of increasing diuretics .
He also has been complaining of abdominal bloating and reports increased size of his abdomen .
He denies any fevers , chills , sweats , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , chest pain and only mild shortness of breath .

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
He is a cachectic and fatigued appearing white male upon admission .
His blood pressure was 98/60 .
His heart rate was 75 .
Respirations of 12 and he was afebrile .
HEENT is notable for extraocular movements being intact , for equal round and reactive pupils and for a clear oropharynx .
Neck :
His JVP was up to his angle of his jaw .
He had soft bilateral bruits versus a trasmissable murmur in his neck .
Lungs :
He had crackles a third of the way up at the bases with poor air movement .
Cardiovascular :
He had an irregularly irregular S1 and S2 with a Grade III / VI holosystolic murmur at the apex and a Grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur at the base with mild radiation to this carotids bilaterally .
He had a positive hepatojugular reflux .
Abdomen :
He had positive bowel sounds .
It was soft .
It was mildly distended with a fluid wave and shifting dullness .
Extremities had 1+ non-pitting pedal edema bilaterally and diffuse ecchymoses and thinned skin .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium of 139 , potassium of 3.2 , chloride of 96 , bicarb of 32.1 , BUN of 79 , creatinine of 3.4 , glucose of 129 , magnesium of 2.2 and albumin of 3.2 , bilirubins of .4/.9 , alkaline phosphatase of 126 , SGOT of 27 , hematocrit of 27.6 , white count of 4.7 , PT of 13.4 , PTT of 26.5 .
His EKG showed atrial fibrillation versus frequent PVC &apos;s and no acute ST-T wave changes indicative of ischemia .
His chest x-ray showed mild cephalization of vessels but no evidence of overwhelming congestive heart failure and no air space disease .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted to the hospital and the following issues were addressed :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient was admitted and placed on IV dobutamine and also IV Lasix for diuresis .
He was also placed on varying vasodilator regimens .
It was thought that his Hydralazine had caused a drug induced lupus .
Initially , he was changed to Cozaar .
His creatinine then began to increase at this time and the patient became hypotensive .
He was then started on amlodipine up to 10 mg. PO QD with more stable blood pressure .
A few days prior to discharge , he was also begun back on his prazosin and currently is at 2 mg. PO QD .
He was aggressively diuresed with a goal dry weight of 121 pounds .
At the time of discharge , he was down to 123 pounds .
This is approximately 10 pounds less than his admission weight .
His dobutamine was discontinued approximately 2 days prior to discharge .
He continued to have a good urine output to a regimen of PO diuresis including Bumex 4 mg. PO BID , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID and Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID .
2. Renal :
The patient has baseline chronic renal insufficiency .
With optimization of his cardiac output and volume status , his creatinine improved to his baseline of 2.0 .
He continues to have approximately 500-700 cc. of urine output every eight hours .
He is fluid restricted to 1 liter of free water .
He should also follow a strict diet including 2 gram salt restriction per day .
3. GU :
The patient has had a Foley in place for several months for urinary retention and BPH .
He has failed a trial of Hydrin after discontinuation of his Foley .
Urology felt that this time that the only other option would be a suprapubic tube which would not decrease the risk of infection .
In consultation with the patient , it was decided to leave the Foley in place and to place him on daily Cipro for UTI prophylaxis .
4. Hematologic :
The patient has mild baseline pancytopenia .
He occasionally has a transfusion .
He was transfused 1 unit of packed red blood cells the day before discharge for a hematocrit of 25 .
His hematocrit at the time of discharge is 30 .
DISPOSITION :
The patient is now discharged stably with a weight of 123 pounds to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lupe Frankcinevirg Asma Ein Health Care</PHI> for further management .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Gentamicin ointment to the left eye QHS , Ativan .5 mg. PO TID , Zaroxolyn 5 mg. PO BID , Colace 100 mg. PO TID , Ciprofloxacin 250 mg. PO QD , amlodipine 10 mg. PO QD , Mevacor 20 mg. PO QD , Nitro-patch .6 mg. per hour once a day , digoxin .125 mg. PO QD , iron sulfate 325 mg. PO TID , Cardura 2 mg. PO QHS , aldactone 50 mg. PO BID , and Bumex 4 mg. PO BID .

(5) Cimetidine , 300 mg. at bedtime .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 40-year-old , right-handed , white male with a Grade III glioma of the cerebellum originally diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/96 .
He was treated at that time with subtotal resection followed by radiation to the lesion .
He had been maintained on low-dose steroid for most of the last 1 years because of increasing symptoms when the medication was tapered .
He was referred to Neuro Oncology Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/28</PHI>/96 with complaints of choking on liquids , increasing facial weakness and imbalance .
He also had reported progressive fatigue and weakness with an inability to arise from a sitting position without the use of his hands .
He had recently had a fall and had to crawl back to his vehicle because of an inability to right himself .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On examination in the office he was obviously cushingoid with a protuberant abdomen and cachectic arms and legs .
His neck was supple with no spinal tenderness .
There was a complete left seventh nerve palsy .
There was horizontal nystagmus on right and left gaze and some beats of vertical nystagmus when looking up or down .
There was 4/5 neck flexor , bilateral deltoid and iliopsoas weakness with wasting of the quadriceps musculature .
His distal strength was relatively preserved .
Sensation to touch was preserved .
There was normal appendicular coordination but obvious truncal ataxia with a widening of his base and an inability to tandem .
On general examination it was also noted that he had oral thrush as well as multiple subcutaneous firm but mobile nodules .
An MRI from <PHI TYPE="DATE">11</PHI>/96 compared to his most recent MRI demonstrated residual enhancing mass near the roof of the left fourth ventricle as well as obvious ependymal enhancement in the frontal horns , body and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles .
The patient was admitted with a diagnosis of recurrent malignant glioma with ependymal spread .
There was also great concern that he had developed cranial neuropathy and was choking and aspirating .
There was also obvious steroid toxicity .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was evaluated by the Speech Pathology Service who identified a mild dysarthria and oral dysphagia .
It was not felt that he was significantly aspirating and a modified barium swallow was not necessary .
He underwent a lumbar puncture on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/29</PHI>/96 which was traumatic , showing 58,000 red blood cells and increased protein .
An ample specimen was sent for cytological analysis .
He also was treated with Nystatin and Mycelex for his oral thrush and his Dexamethasone was changed to Prednisone in an effort to improve the weakness due to his steroid myopathy .
He was also given Lacri-Lube for the left eye as it was not fully closing due to his facial palsy .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/30</PHI>/96 back to his home in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sastonton-mont , Ohio</PHI> .
He will be enrolled in an experimental chemotherapy protocol for recurrent malignant glioma .
The case will be discussed at Brain Tumor Conference on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/03</PHI>/96 .
He will also start a physical therapy program for the steroid myopathy once he is back in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Sler</PHI> .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
This 88-year-old male with history of prostate CA was admitted from an outside hospital secondary to persistent hematuria status post nephrostomy tube placement transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for further management .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Prehekote</PHI> is an 88-year-old Portuguese speaking only male who was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma of the prostate in 1998 .
He received transurethral resection of the prostate one year ago because of persistent urinary retention .
After that , he was on Lupron and Nilandron hormone therapy .
The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 23</PHI> , 1999 to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> because of failure to thrive and decreased hematocrit .
He was noted to have elevated BUN and creatinine .
BUN was 34 and creatinine was 2.6 , up from his baseline of 1.0 .
Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .
Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .
Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">February 28</PHI> , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .
However after the procedure , the patient &apos;s hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .
His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .
He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .
Due to the persistent blood in the urine , he was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Eifro Medical Center</PHI> to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Retelk County Medical Center</PHI> for angiographic studies to rule out any vascular injuries .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Genearocktemp Ry Health</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 3</PHI> , 1999 .

LABORATORY DATA :
On admission the patient &apos;s biochemistry showed sodium of 140 , potassium 4.0 , chloride 107 , bicarb 14 , BUN 63 , creatinine 5.8 , blood sugar 133 .
Liver function test showed AST 21 , alkaline phosphatase 70 , total bilirubin 0.3 , total protein 6.5 , albumin 3.9 , globulin 2.6 .
CBC :
WBC 8.4 , hematocrit 32.6 , platelet count 194,000 .
PT 11.9 , INR 1.0 , PTT 28.4 .
Chest x-ray showed no evidence of cardiomegaly .
No lung infiltrate .
CT scan of the renal area showed right hydronephrosis which extends to an asymmetrically thickened urinary bladder wall .
A mass like thickening of the urinary bladder suggestive of either detrusor hypertrophy or possibly tumor .
The CT scan showed a cavitary lung lesion in the right lower lobe compatible with metastatic or septic embolus .
EKG showed atrial fibrillation , left axis deviation , LVH , nonspecific ST-T changes either due to digitalis affect .
CK enzymes 146 .
Repeated three times and remained flat .
Troponin I on the second day of admission was 1.18 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
After admission , urology , nephrology as well as interventional radiology was consulted about the management of this patient .
The specialist concluded that because the patient &apos;s hematuria seemed to be stable and hematocrit to maintain at about 29-30 , there is no urgent need to do an arteriogram which may cause further damage to the patient &apos;s kidney .
Urology consultation thinks that cystoscopy would not add any benefit to the management and only would consider a right nephrostomy if renal function failed to improve .
After admission , the patient was treated conservatively to correct his electrolyte and metabolic acidosis .
He was given blood transfusion , two units when his hematocrit dropped to 29.4 .
After transfusion , the patient &apos;s hematocrit rose to 37.7 on the day of discharge .
The patient was also given sodium bicarbonate to correct his metabolic acidosis .
He continued to pass about 1500-2000 cc of urine a day and his renal function improved slowly with creatinine decreased to 4.2 on the day of discharge .
During this admission , the patient also developed atrial fibrillation with ventricular rate of about 70-80 .
CPK was tracked , but was totally normal .
No beta blockers were given .
A long discussion amongst the specialist , nephrology , urology , interventional radiology , primary oncology as well with the family lead to the conclusion that conservative management may give the patient more comfort than crisis treatment in this well advanced prostate CA .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lucreamull</PHI> discussed the patient &apos;s clinical status and overall situation with the patient &apos;s family and the family decided that Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Prehekote</PHI> could return home with hospice .
The patient &apos;s primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tomedankell Flowayles</PHI> will manage the hospice issues .
The patient was discharged to home for hospice on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 8</PHI> , 1999 .

Chest x-ray showed enlarged heart with mild pulmonary vascular redistribution , no gross congestive heart failure was noted .
EKG showed question of MAT vs. atrial fibrillation with a ventricular response of 118 , axis was 0 degrees .
There was ST scooping in the lateral leads consistent with Dig vs. a question of chronic ischemia changes .
There was no significant change from his baseline EKG .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and placed in isolation on neutropenic precautions .
He was transfused with 1/2 units of packed red blood cells and given Lasix periodically to prevent him from going into congestive heart failure has he had on his prior transfusion .
Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .
The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 &apos;s range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .
He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 &apos;s after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .
His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11-7</PHI>-93 .
The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .
It is unclear why the patient did not bump his hematocrit more but he did not appear to be hemolyzing from laboratory data , that is his LDH was within normal limits .
In addition , multiple stools were guaiaced and were all guaiac negative .
The patient was discharged with follow-up with his Hematologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Eci Area</PHI> and Rheumatologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Taange Peter</PHI> , and Cardiologist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Peter</PHI> .

HISTORY :
Patient is a 73-year-old retired cook with a history of cervical myelopathy , who is admitted for new left hemiparesis .
He had undergone C-spine surgery for spinal stenosis with a question of myelopathy and radiculopathy in 1992 with residual spastic paresis and monoparesis of the left upper extremity , but was ambulatory until a day prior to admission .
At his baseline , he was able to perform limited tasks with his left upper extremity , and was clearly able to move his hand and able to ambulate .
He also at baseline has had urinary and fecal urgencies / incontinence .
His history is now that he has had a week of progressive left upper extremity weakness , to the point of being unable to move the left hand and one day of being unable to walk secondary to left leg weakness with a marked tendency to fall leftward .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Notable for anemia , hypercholesterolemia , narcolepsy for the past 6 years on Dexedrine , impotence with decreased testosterone , status post implant , peptic ulcer disease , status post duodenal resection , cervical stenosis , status post decompression &apos;92 , hernia , status post herniorrhaphy .

No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Dexedrine 5 mg per day and Motrin 600 mg tid .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission , older , black gentleman in no acute distress with left upper extremity flex across his chest .
His temperatureis 98.9 .
His pressure is 150/90 .
Rate 76 .
Respirations 16 .
He was edentulous .
He had mild copper wiring .
He has a I / VI systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border .
Heart sounds were normal and regular .
Breath sounds were equal bilaterally with course rhonchi .
He had a midline abdominal scar and a reducible umbilical hernia .
Abdomen was otherwise soft and nontender .
He had 2+ carotids , no bruits .
He had gynecomastia .
Rectal was guaiac negative with brown stool , good tone but unable to squeeze .
Extremities :
1+ right posterior tibialis , 2+ left posterior tibialis , no edema , ichthyotic changes were present .
He had 0 left wrist flexion or extension while his left proximal muscles were 4 including his biceps and triceps .
His right arm muscles were also in the range of 4/5.
His hip flexion was 4+ on the right and 4- on the left ; extension 5 on the right , 4+ on the left ; knee flexion evidently trace on the right and 4- on the left with knee extension 5- on the left , 5 on the right ; knee flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right ; ankle dorsi flexion 4- on the left , trace on the right .
Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .
His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .
He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .
Mental state :
He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> and the date .
He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .
Coordination :
his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .
He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .
LABORATORY DATA :
Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .
Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .
On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Finger</PHI> was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .
He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .
However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .
He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .
Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .
The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .
Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient &apos;s exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .
He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .
A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .
MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .
Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .
His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .
However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .
This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .
While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .
He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .
In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .
He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .
I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .
He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .
Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .
He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .
At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .
We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .
He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/05</PHI>/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .
Follow up will be with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tvi Fine</PHI> of Neurology , and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Doll Grendbly</PHI> of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Metastatic breast cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSES :
Dehydration , generalized anxiety disorder .
HISTORY AND REASONS FOR HOSPITALIZATION :
This 75-year-old woman presented on week prior to admission with nausea .
An enlarged liver was noted and ultrasound and CT scan showed multiple probable metastatic lesions .
She presented on the day of admission with nausea and weakness and was admitted for observation and coordination of treatment .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a weak , elderly woman in a wheel chair who could not walk without assistance .
Blood pressure 140/90 , pulse 80 , no cervical , supraclavicular or axillary adenopathy .
On the breasts , multiple , erythematous , scaly plaques with underlying induration and inversion of the nipple on the right , left breast without masses .
Abdomen :
Liver span 12 cm firm with mild , right upper quadrant tenderness .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Included a hematocrit of 41 , a white of 10,500 , platelets of 298 , alkaline phosphatase of 162 , potassium of 3.3 and remaining liver function tests and electrolytes normal .
EKG showed normal sinus rhythm without abnormalities .
Chest x-ray was clear .
RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was begun on intravenous hydration shortly after admission because of very poor PO fluid intake .
Diagnostic work up included a fine needle aspiration of her right breast lesion which revealed ductal carcinoma , with estrogen and progesterone receptor status pending at the time of discharge .
She had a bone scan which showed multiple areas of increased uptake , particularly in L1 , L3 and L4 , as well as the left sixth posterior rib .
This corresponded to a site of pain reported by the patient .
Her abdominal CT scan showed multiple lesions in the liver with enlarged periportal lymph nodes , cholelithiasis , and a left adrenal mass thought to likely represent metastatic disease .
During her hospitalization , the main issues were pain control and nausea .
Her pain was ultimately helped most by a regimen of oxycodone and oxycontin , and nausea responded to p.r.n. Trilafon .
She was somewhat sedated on this regimen , and her standing Serax dose was reduced with substitution of Klonopin .
She was seen by Radiation Medicine for palliative XRT to the painful lesions in her LS spine , and radiation therapy was begun on <PHI TYPE="DATE">10/2</PHI>/97 with the plan for approximately 10 daily treatments .
She required considerable encouragement to maintain PO intake , and required intravenous hydration to achieve adequate fluid intake during her hospitalization .
A Physical Therapy evaluation could not be completed because of her degree of pain and nausea .
She is being discharged to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linghs County Medical Center</PHI> , with plans for continuing her tamoxifen pending estrogen receptor status availability which should be available within the coming week .
She will also continue x-ray therapy treatment and being physical therapy as tolerated .

2 ) HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY .
3 ) END STAGE RENAL DISEASE ON DIALYSIS .
HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Vinktlandfreierm</PHI> was admitted from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Owaleharbo Tanaminer Hospital</PHI> to which he had been discharged approximately four days prior to admission .
He was noted to have dark stools per rectum and to be somewhat fluid overloaded .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He was admitted and found to have a significant hematocrit drop from 33.8 to 24.3 .
He was found operation be short of breath and was taken to dialysis for apparent fluid overload .
His gastrointestinal bleeding issues were investigated with an upper endoscopy which revealed multiple superficial gastric ulcerations consistent with an non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs gastropathy .
He had been discharged on one aspirin a day with 20 of Prilosec b.i.d.
The aspirin was discontinued and he had no further problems with gastrointestinal bleeding and a stable hematocrit the rest of his hospitalization .
During the course of his hospitalization , he became increasingly lethargic .
An extensive work-up was done for any metabolic abnormalities which was unrevealing .
He responded somewhat to lactulose for hepatic encephalopathy .
He had one positive blood culture for Vancomycin resistant enterococcus .
In the few days prior to his demise , he was intermittently somewhat lethargic buton the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 25</PHI> , 1999 , his white count was noted to have increased from 8 to 13,000 .
That day , he was found to be acutely short of breath with a respiratory rate of 40 and oxygen saturations in the mid seventies .
He was put on 100% nonrebreather and his oxygen saturations improved to the low nineties .
Nasal trumpet suction was done and he was found to have food like material that was easily suctioned out .
He was also found to havesome pieces of toast in his mouth .
Blood gases were done and he was found to have a pH of 7.2 with a pCO2 of 21 .
Fingerstick glucose revealed a sugar of 12 .
A stat panel 7 confirmed that the sugar was 23 and that he had a new anion gap of 40 .
Repeat blood gas was done which was almost identical to the first .
The family was called and came in to see the patient .
An extensive family meeting was held and the family agreed that it did not make sense to intubate the patient and send him to the Intensive Care Unit .
In the acute setting , he had been started on levofloxacin , Flagyl , and Vancomycin .
These antibiotics were continued but the family decided that they wanted us to emphasize the comfort of the patient and pursue no further invasive measures .
The patient was made do not resuscitate / do not intubate .
At 2:30 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 26</PHI> , 1999 , I was called to see the patient who had expired .
DISPOSITION :
The family was notified and came in to see the patient .
The family declined an autopsy saying that they felt that the patient had been through enough .
The patient &apos;s attending physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Erm Neidwierst</PHI> , was notified as well .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeguayfalc</PHI> is an 87 year old white male with multiple medical problems including hypertension , paroxysmal atrial fibrillation , Alzheimer &apos;s disease versus multi-infarct dementia , and akylosing spondylitis who was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/05</PHI>/93 to the Surgical Service with a chief complaint of bright red blood per rectum .
Barium Enema showed diverticula .
He was doing well on the Surgical Service until <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/08</PHI>/93 when he experienced the acute onset of dyspnea and desaturation .
He was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
He ruled in for myocardial infarction by EKG and enzyme criteria .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit , his do not resuscitate status was clarified by his legal guardian .
It was Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Fyfeguayfalc</PHI> &apos;s wish to not be resuscitated , no intubation , no pressors , and no defibrillation .
He was extubated on the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/08</PHI>/93 and was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Loui Dingspar Chepidster Medical Center</PHI> the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/09</PHI>/93 .
At approximately 1:10 p.m. , he experienced the abrupt onset of increased dyspnea with O2 saturation in the seventies while eating lunch .
He became tachypneic and confused with labored breathing and a respiratory rate in the thirties .
He was placed on 100% non-rebreather with O2 saturation of 79% .
Blood pressure was 172/70 .
He was given one sublingual Nifedipine , a total of 4 mg of Morphine , and 20 mg of Lasix without significant result .
Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19 , pCO2 74 , pO2 50 , and O2 saturation of 73% .
Chest X-Ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate which was new , a left lower lobe infiltrate , and no edema .
Lungs had scattered rhonchi with little air movement .
He was suctioned with return of food particles , presumed aspiration .
His O2 saturation remained in the sixties to seventies despite repeated nebulizers and suctioning .
A decision was made to not bronchoscope the patient because of his do not resuscitate status .
He expired on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/09</PHI>/93 at 2:25 p.m.

2. PULMONARY EMBOLUS , <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-14</PHI>-94 .
3. DIARRHEA , NAUSEA AND VOMITING , FEVER .
4. HISTORY OF OVARIAN CYST RESECTION , 1975 .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 49 year old woman with a metastatic adenocarcinoma of the breast who is status post high dose chemotherapy with PBSE and CCSS support ending <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 1994 .
She was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-5</PHI>-94 for fever , chest wall ulceration , cellulitis and pain control .
The patient first presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1991 with a tender right axillary mass .
A mammogram done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> 1990 was negative .
However , mammography repeated in <PHI TYPE="DATE">October</PHI> 1991 showed bilateral breast masses , suspicious for carcinoma .
Fine needle aspiration on <PHI TYPE="DATE">October 23</PHI> , 1991 demonstrated atypical cells which occurred singly and in clusters .
Staging evaluation included normal liver function tests , normal blood counts and normal chest x-ray .
Bone scan showed degenerative joint disease in the shoulders and lumbar spine as well as increased radio chaser uptake in the breast bilaterally .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Berca Gachfrum</PHI> performed a right modified mastectomy and left simple mastectomy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 4</PHI> , 1991 .
The right modified radical mastectomy contained a 5.5 cm poorly differentiated , Grade III out of III infiltrating ductal carcinoma .
The margins were free of tumor , but 10 out of 21 lymph nodes were positive for metastatic carcinoma .
Furthermore there was a mass on the right pectoralis muscle which is supposed to be metastatic cancer .
The left simple mastectomy also contained 5.5 cm poorly differentiated infiltrating ductal and intraductal carcinoma with extensive lymphatic vessel invasion .
Estrogen receptor was 0% by ERICA .
The patient developed a large hematoma requiring surgical drainage .
Therefore she had a Stage III-A adenocarcinoma of the breast .
Since she was at high risk for both local and metastatic recurrence of her tumor , she received both systemic chemotherapy and radiation therapy .
The patient was treated with CMSAP , which is Cytoxan , Methotrexate , Leukovoranrescue , 5-FU , Adriamycin and Prednisone for four cycles .
There were no dose reductions for mucositis or myelosuppression .
However , following cycle 4 , she developed a flu-like illness , followed by fever , nonproductive cough and dyspnea on exertion .
ABGs showed a pO2 of 79 , pH 7.44 , pO2 33 .
Chest x-ray showed diffuse interstitial infiltrates .
The differential diagnosis included viral pneumonitis , Mycoplasma , Chlamydia .
Basically in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> 1993 , she returned to the Hem / Onc Clinic with chest wall nodules which turned out to be tumor recurrences and biopsied .
Although she had mediastinal recurrence , bone scan , head and liver CT were negative for metastatic disease .
She was thus started on a Protocol of high dose chemotherapy with GCSF and peripheral stem cell support .
Complications has mainly included myelosuppression and mucositis .
She also developed Klebsiella UTI after the second cycle of high dose chemotherapy .
It was treated with gent and Cipro .
Re-staging done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> 1993 showed a decrease in the pretracheal nodes with question of some lymphangitic spread versus some pneumonitis .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> 1994 she received her first course of thiotepa and Velban and Methotrexate , which required some red cell transfusions .
In mid <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> she was admitted for fever and neutropenia and at that time had a UTI with blood clots in the urine .
The patient presents today with complaints of fever and a temperature of 100 .
She has also been having diarrhea since <PHI TYPE="DATE">November</PHI> and her other complaints of admission include confusion , nausea and vomiting .
We will include a very thorough HPI with this dictation that was done by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wedleung</PHI> .

There was no HSM .
Extremities - Her left arm was very swollen .
It was tested with no voluntary movement except at the finger tips .
There was no edema elsewhere in her extremities , only the left arm .
Neuro - The patient was oriented to place , but had difficulty with recent memory .
She also had mild weakness in the left extremities , both upper and lower .
Cranial nerves II - XII were grossly intact .
Toes were downgoing .
LABORATORY DATA :
Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .
PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .

Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .
UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .
Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .
In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .
The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .
When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .
So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .
Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .
She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .
Another major issue with this patient was pain control .
She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .
So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .
One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1-6</PHI>-94 .
After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .
However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .
So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .
She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .
She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .
We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .
Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">8th of January</PHI> because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .
We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .
In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .
That has been stable .
The patient on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 13</PHI> became hyponatremic .
Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .
A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .
We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .
We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .
In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient &apos;s sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.
So that has really improved .
We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th of January</PHI> , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton &apos;s hump .
Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .
So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.
Her INR is 2.3 .
We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .
So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .
However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .
Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .
We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .
So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .
If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .
The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .
She is also a little dry .
The patient is on oxygen .
Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .
She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .
We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .
The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .
DISPOSITION :
Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Fair .
She remains very weak and will most likely benefit from some physical therapy andshe still has the bilateral edema .
She is to go to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Necsoncardel Medical Center</PHI> for more chronic care .
Follow-up is with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Wedleung</PHI> in the Hem / Onc in two weeks .
The appointment has already been made .
The patient is very limited in how much she can do right now because of her pain primarily and her difficulty breathing .

The patient was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Doll Grendbly</PHI> from the Neurology Service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had Parkinson &apos;s Disease with certainly some Parkinsonian features to his picture .
However , some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that .
There was also a question of Alzheimer &apos;s Disease to explain his dementia .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Block</PHI> recommended a trial of Sinemet therapy which was begun in the hospital and he was then transferred to are habilitation hospital for vigorous physical therapy and further evaluation of his Sinemet trial .

History of colon cancer status post hemicolectomy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 76 year old white male with severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who has had several recent admissions to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> for respiratory insuffiencey most often secondary to pneumonia .
He was most recently discharged from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/06</PHI>/99 and was then transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Linghs County Medical Center</PHI> from which he was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">03/20</PHI>/99 .
The patient was doing relatively at home until one day prior to admission he complained discomfort over a suprapubic catheter area .
The patient had missed his usual monthly change of his suprapubic catheter and felt discomfort and noticed some blood at the site of the catheter .
The patient was brought to the Emergency Room one day prior to admission where he was evaluated by Urology and had his catheter changed .
The patient at that time noted slight shortness of breath but was sent home anyway .
On the day of admission the patient noticed increasing shortness of breath .

He also denies any chest pain .
No orthopnea .
No paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea .
The patient had been taking his usual medications and using his nasal oxygen at home .
By the time the patient arrived at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room he was in moderate respiratory distress .
His initial blood gases on 40% 02 was P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 .
The patient was given respiratory therapy in the way of nebulizer treatments in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room because of a longstanding desire by patient and family to refrain from intubation to be considered Do Not Resuscitate .
The patient was not intubated .
However he was transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit where he received continuous respiratory therapy in theway of Albuterol nebulizers as well as nasal oxygen , intravenous steroids and intravenous antibiotics .
A chest x-ray in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room showed new changes on his chest x-ray on top of his usual severe bilateral emphysema_____ with scarring in both lungs .
There were new air space opacifications in the left apex and the right lower lobe .
These were thought to be consistent either with pneumonia or asymmetric pulmonary edema .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Associated medical problems include :
1. Atonic bladder with a suprapubic tube .
2. Anxiety .
3. Coronary artery disease with a history of angina in the distant past .
4. History of colon cancer with a colectomy in the past .

He had a blood pressure 110/70 , heart rate 110 beats per minute and regular , respiratory rate 25 .
He was in moderate respiratory distress .
His temperature was 98F .
He had a normal head , eyes , ears , nose and throat exam .
Neck exam revealed no jugular venous distention and no masses .
Lung exam revealed decreased breath sounds as well as crackles in the bases .
There were no wheezes or rhonchi .
Heart exam revealed a soft S1 and S2 , no murmur was heard , no S3 .
Abdomen was soft , nontender with no masses palpable .
Rectal exam was unremarkable with stool heme negative .
Neurological exam revealed an alert and oriented x 3 elderly male .
He moved all extremities .
Deep tendon reflexes were symmetrical in all extremities .
LABORATORY AND RADIOLOGIC DATA :
Sodium 148 , potassium 3.4 , glucose 174 , P02 102 , PC02 115 , PH 7.11 on 40% 02 .
Blood urea nitrogen 11 , creatinine .6 , uric acid 3.0 , alkaline phosphatase 78 , creatinine phosphokinase isoenzymes too low , hematocrit 41 , white blood cell count 11.6 .
Urine analysis showed 20-50 white blood cells and 3-5 red blood cells .
Electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia at a rate of 123 beats per minute compared to previous electrocardiogram of <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/29</PHI> there were no significant changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was stabilized in the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
He stayed in the unit for about one day .
During that period of time he received nebulizer treatments with Albuterol .
He was also started on intravenous Ticarcillin for possible gram negative pneumonia .
He was diuresed with intravenous Lasix to which he responded with at lease a 2L urine output on the first day and 1.5L the second day .
After one day in the Medical Intensive Care Unit the patient was stable enough to go to the floor where he continued the rest of his treatment .
This consisted of continued nebulizer treatments as well as intravenous antibiotics and intravenous Solu-Medrol .
As the patient &apos;s diuresis continued his respiratory status improved .
A chest x-ray showed clearing of the opacities in the chest x-ray that were consistent with pulmonary edema because he continued to have some abnormality in the right lower lobe .
The patient was continued on antibiotics for possible pneumonia .
The antibiotic chosen was Levaquin 500 mg 1 tab per day .
This was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/2</PHI>/99 and should be continued for ten days .
The Ticarcillin was stopped after two days when it was felt that he did not have a serious pneumonia .
The patient &apos;s respiratory status continued to improve but towards the last 2-3 days of his hospitalization the amount of improvement was minimal .
It was felt that his respiratory status has been maximally treated by then .
The patient &apos;s major improvement came after the first two days with brisk diuresis with Lasix .
While in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> the patient on <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/4</PHI>/99 complained of mild epigastric discomfort because he was put in Cimetidine while in the Intensive Care Unit for prophylaxis against peptic ulcer disease .
The patient was upgraded to Prilosec 20 mg per day for possible treatment of gastritis or gastroesophageal reflux disease .
The patient did have any nausea , vomiting or evidence of gastrointestinal bleeding .
The patient &apos;s abdominal pain should be followed over the next week or so in case it does not respond to Prilosec .
While in <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> the patient was never able to get out of bed and walk independently .
It is hoped that when he is transferred to a rehab facility that he will continue with physical therapy to regain his strength and regain independence in activities of daily living .
Discussion with the family regarding the possibility of sending him to a nursing home was entertained however the family strongly refused to allow him to go a nursing home .
They wanted the patient to return to his home after a stay at a rehab facility .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient &apos;s respiratory status was stable .
I think his breathing was as good as to be expected with the amount of severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease he had .
He needed to go to a rehab facility for continued respiratory therapy and for Physical Therapy to increase his muscle strength .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Albuterol 2.5 mg in 2.5 normal saline q4h .
2. Heparin 5000 units subcutaneously twice a day .
3. Ativan .5 mg twice a day .
4. Nasal oxygen 3L per minute .
5. Levaquin 500 mg per day to be continued until <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/12</PHI>/99 .
6. Lasix 40 mg per day .
7. Prednisone 40 mg per day to be tapered over two weeks .
8. Xalatan eyedrops 1 gtt in left eye per day .
9. Alphagan 1 gtt in left eye three times a day .
10. Trusopt 1gtt in left eye three times a day .
11. Prilosec 20 mg per day .
FOLLOWUP :
The patient should have follow up with his primary care physician Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rod Linkeboltshieltrus</PHI> at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">TRE 453</PHI> about one week after discharge from rehab facility .
The telephone number at his office is <PHI TYPE="PHONE">236-4518</PHI> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 64 year old patient initially admitted to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riode Area</PHI> status post an aorto bifemoral bypass in <PHI TYPE="DATE">01</PHI>/98 with an end to end proximal and to the common femoral bilaterally .
The patient has had recurrent claudication for the last five months and has developed lesions on the first toe which is apparently similar to aparonychia .
He had an angiogram which shows a severe stenosis in the right distal area with a thrombosing right limb of an aorto femoral graft .
He also has an irregular lesion at the profunda femoris origin and with the superficial femoral occluded bilaterally .
He was therefore admitted to the hospital for an ileofemoral bypass .
The patient unfortunately continues to smoke and has greater than a 50 pack year history of smoking and by notes of Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Area</PHI> &apos;s office , this has been discussed at length with him and the implications of the smoking .
He has a history of a deep vein thrombosis and a question of a pulmonary embolism with what is thought to be a non fully documented hypercoagulable state .
He had a left superficial femoral artery interposition graft around 1990 which is non functioning at the present time , most of which was done at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Alconspore Woocawo Medical Center</PHI> .
ALLERGIES :
The patient has no known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
His medications on admission include Coumadin and Levofloxacin .
His Coumadin has been held for two days .
His claudication is equal bilaterally .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On physical examination was remarkable for no carotid bruits , a ventral hernia without any masses which was reasonably reducible .
His rectal exam was refused at the time of surgery since apparently it was negative at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tocon Hospital</PHI> the previous week .
He has a first and fourth toe which had some purulent discharge around the toes with ischemic modeled toes and on the left side there were no lesions in the feet .
His pulse exam was a femoral pulse bilaterally , but none distally .
LABORATORY DATA :
His BUN and creatinine were within normal limits at 16 and 1.3 and his hematocrit was 44 with a white blood count of 10,000 and 139,000 platelet count .
He has ankle brachial indices of .36 bilaterally but with his right toes appearing ischemic with lesions he would most likely not heal these lesions .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Area</PHI> had asked me to see the patient and after discussing with the patient it was agreed that I would proceed with revascularization of his right leg since he had a angiogram which demonstrated a failing limb of his aortofemoral graft and a tight profundus stenosis .
After discussing with the patient , getting his prothrombin time closer to range , he was brought to the operating room where a ileo profunda bypass was performed with an 8 mm .
EP to FE under general endotracheal anesthesia .
There was copious thrombus in the distal right limb of the aortofemoral graft which also had a thromboendarterectomy performed and excellent inflow was achieved .
Superficial femoral artery was divided since it was also chronically occluded .
There was a significant amount of thrombus at the anastomosis as well which had developed a small aneurysmaltype of dilatation , although there was no dehiscence of the anastomosis .
The profunda had been opened beyond the origin stenosis and the bypass was then performed providing and excellent flow to the calf and excellent pulsevolume recordings were obtained with strong upstrokes .
It was therefore elected not to proceed with a distal bypass graft to the popliteal arteries which would have been required should this not have worked .
The patient postoperatively did quite well .
He had continued good post volume recordings and there was no question that with this improved circulation and Silvadene dressings to his toes that they actually started to heal in his postoperative course with improved perfusion and capillary refill .
His groin incision was healing nicely and he was on Heparin , being converted to Coumadin .
Because of the issue relating to his hypercoagulable state , and the need for getting him in range , he was keptin the hospital and not discharged .
The orders of his wounds and wound care were clarified and he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Frontera 34</PHI> to ensure that this would be performed properly .
No cellulitis was present , and the patient had indicated his desire to be discharged .
Despite loading him on Coumadin , his prothrombin time and INR increased slowly and he left the hospital without discharge order or discharge planning on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">18th of December</PHI> .
I had called the patient and discussed with him his care , which he had been then transferring to his local medical doctor for anticoagulation purposes .
I explained to the patient that because of his early discharge I would not be able to be responsible for his care but would be happy to see him in theoffice for removal of his sutures and an appointment for that was undertaken .

ASSESSMENT :
This is a 74 year old woman with a vague poorly defined history of coronary disease and EKGs and history consistent with previous myocardial infarction who now presents hypertension , tachycardia , nausea and chest tightness with EKG changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Hospital course by system :
1. CARDIAC :
The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .
She was placed on Nitropaste .
She was given Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
She was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .
Her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with CKs of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , She was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/31</PHI>/96 which showed an EF of 35% .
She had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .
A diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .
There was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .
The estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .
The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .
There was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .
Given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ACE inhibitor , Captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .
This was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .
She also underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/1</PHI>/96 which showed nondiagnostic EKG response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .
She will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .
Given her recent start on an ACE inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , BUN and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ACE inhibitor .
Given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .
However , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of Lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .
She will not be transferred on Lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .
NEUROLOGY :
From a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .
She was initially managed with prn Haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including Depakote , Prozac , Klonopin and Trilafon .
She gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .
However , she does express frequent need for attention .
She appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .
In talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .
3. HYPERTENSION :
From the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on Nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ACE inhibitor as mentioned above .
The Nifedipine was discontinued on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/1</PHI>/96 in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .
Her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .
ORTHOPEDICS :
She did have right knee pain and swelling .
She underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .
Her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .
DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :
She will be followed by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nelson</PHI> who follows her at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Montden Hospital</PHI> .
She will be transferred on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/2</PHI>/96 in good condition .
Transfer Medications :
Metropolol 25 mg po bid , Captopril 25 mg po tid , Depakote 250 mg po qid , enteric coated aspirin 325 mg po qd , Colace 100 mg potid , Prozac 20 mg po qd , Clonipine .5 mg po qhs , Trilifon 2 mg po bid and Darvocet 1 tab po q6h prn for pain .

HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
At the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> he was quite hypotensive , requiring dopamine at 1,000 , Levo at 12 .
His chest x-ray showed diffuse patchy infiltrates on left lung with left upper lung patchy infiltrates and right hemidiaphragm elevated , consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome from possible pneumonia .
A urinalysis was obtained which showed blood , urine sediment was active with positive dysmorphic cells , red cell casts , and 1+ albumin with mild protein uria .
The patient had ANCA , anti-GBM , anti-streptolycin , ANA , UPEP , SPEP , renal ultrasound , hepatitis C cryoglobulin sent out .
He had a bronchoscopy immediately done which showed no fresh blood , just old clot and a pulmonary arterial line placed in the right internal jugular vein .
Question of pulmonary-renal syndrome was raised .
The patient subsequently deteriorated over time , was started on CVVH and suffered significant complications without improvement of his pulmonary / renal situation .
A family meeting was held on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-2</PHI>-98 and it was decided that the patient should be made comfort care only .
All CVVH and the ventilator was removed and the patient spontaneously passed away on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5-2</PHI>-98 , at 4:55 p.m.

He has no asterixis .
LABORATORY VALUES ;
Hematocrit of 30.9 , which was decreased from a hematocrit of 33 , at a blood sample drawn three hours prior .
PT 13.5 , PTT29 , platelet count 165 , electrolytes notable only for a potassium of 4.8 , amylase of 73 , bilirubin of total 5 , direct 4.4 , SGOT of 88 , alk phos of 458 , EKG is normal sinus rhythm .
Chest xray shows bilateral pleural effusions , left greater than right .
CT scan of the abdomen revealed adensity in the portal vein as well as an abnormal area in the liver , consistent with possible infarct , although abscess and malignancy cannot be ruled out .
HOSPITAL COURSE ;
The patient was admitted and taken to the intensive care unit for monitoring .
He received approximately four units of blood transfusion and then maintained a hematocrit of greater than 25 .
The GI radiology service was consulted and on the morning after admission a TIPS procedure was performed .
At that time , the patient was noted to have a preprocedure gradient of 24 , a post procedure gradient of 9 to 11 .
He is noted to have a large left gastric varus which was embolized .
He had a nonocclusive thrombus in the right and left branches of the portal vein , however , the main portal vein , splenic vein , SMV , IMV were all patent .
He had a large recannalized umbilical vein and was dilated to 12 mm in diameter .
Post procedure , the patient did exceptionally well , he never had any sign of recurrent GI bleeds .
He was transferred to the floor in stable condition .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/21</PHI>/95 he was taken to the operating room at which time an EDG was performed which showed several smaller esophageal varices with two larger varices at the gastroesophageal junction .
There was no evidence of gastric varices .
These two varices were banded without difficulty .
Postoperatively the patient did quite well , he was kept NPO for 24 hours and then gradually started on clear liquids .
He is tolerating a soft solid diet upon discharge .
His discharge hematocrit is approximately 25.8 .
He has been restarted on his regimen of diuretics including Aldactone and Lasix .
The patient was noted to be fairly hypotensive throughout his hospitalization despite aggressive fluid resuscitation .
This is believed to be secondary to his Inderal dose .
Subsequently his beta blocker dose was decreased to 5 mg po qid and his discharge blood pressure is approximately 95/45 .
Additionally his potassium dose was decreased to 20 qd for his admission potassium of 4.8 .
He is continued on his Ofloxacin prophylaxis for SBP throughout his hospitalization and will be discharged home on this as well .
Notably while the patient has a small pleural effusion , he does not have any evidence of ascites at this time .
The patient continues to be a candidate for possible liver transplant and his evaluation for placement on the transplant list is still in progress .
The patient is awaiting a final evaluation from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sintnieves</PHI> of the Addiction Services Team .
He was in Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sintnieves</PHI> &apos;s office at the time of his hematemesis on the day of admission and was seen again by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sintnieves</PHI> while hospitalized .
He has been told to follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Sintnieves</PHI> again after discharge .
Again , the patient is quite adamant that he wished to pursue liver transplant and will follow through with all physician recommendations as needed to insure his candidacy .
Notably , the patient did not develop any encephalopathic signs post TIPS procedure , however he was started on Lactulose to prevent any mild mental status changes .

ADMISSION DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94
DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Hepatic metastases from colon cancer .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
1. Colon cancer ,
2. disseminated intravascular coagulopathy .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
1. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94 , right trisegmentectomy ( hepatic resection ) .
ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES :
1. On <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 , exploratory laparotomy for bleeding ,
2. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 , exploratory right thoracoabdominal incision for bleeding .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 42 year old female with known metastatic colon carcinoma , limited to the liver , who is referred to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Duhenile</PHI> for placement of an internal pump for hepatic arterial chemotherapy .
The patient initially presented in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1992 with bloody diarrhea .
She subsequently underwent a right colectomy in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1992 for a Duke &apos;s C-II moderately well differentiated adenocarcinoma of the hepatic flexure .
She subsequently recent adjuvant 5-FU and levamisole therapy but developed a right hepatic metastasis in <PHI TYPE="DATE">September</PHI> of 1993 .
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</PHI> of 1993 , the patient underwent a partial right hepatectomy .
Postoperatively , she did well , however she was noted to have a rising carcinoembryonic antigen level in <PHI TYPE="DATE">February</PHI> of 1994 , of 5.7 , and a 42.1 in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1994 .
A computerized tomography scan obtained in <PHI TYPE="DATE">April</PHI> of 1994 revealed hepatic metastases involving both lobes .
After two additional cycles of 5-FU and leucovorin , the patient had marked progression of her hepatic metastases associated with tumor fevers .
The computerized tomography scans continued to demonstrate disease confined to the liver .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-28</PHI>-94 for placement of an infusaid pump versus an exploratory laparotomy for liver resection .
Prior to surgery , the patient was taken to Vascular Radiology where she underwent superior mesenteric artery and ciliac angiograms .
These demonstrated
1. portal vein patent ,
2. normal hepaticanatomy with normal right and left hepatic arteries ,
3. an enlarged liver with necrotic regions consistent with known colon metastatic tumors .
The patient was subsequently brought to the Operating Room where she underwent a hepatic right trisegmentectomy .
The operative findings were notable for a softball sized tumor in the right lobe of the liver , as well as multiple smaller tumor nodules .
The left lateral segment was grossly free of tumor .
The intraoperative course was notable for acute hypotension with a systolic blood pressure in the fifties .
The patient received 21 liters of lactated Ringers solution , 16 units of packed red blood cells , and 21 units of fresh frozen plasma , and 12 units of platelets .
There were 5300 cc given via the Cellsaver .
The patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the ensuing hours , the patient continued to have ongoing blood loss with hypotension .
The decision was made to return the patient to the operating room .
The patient was then returned to the operating room for an exploratory laparotomy for bleeding .
The operative findings were notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava .
The patient was returned again to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , again the patient continued to demonstrate ongoing hypotension and transfusion requirements .
The patient required blood pressure support with pressors .
Due to output of approximately 950 cc on placement of a right chest tube , the decision was made to return tothe operating room for exploration for bleeding .
The patient was therefore explored through a right thoracoabdominal incision .
The abdomen was again notable for bleeding from the inferior vena cava , a notable coagulopathy , and therefore , the abdomen was packed and the patient was returned to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
However , over the subsequent 8-10 hours , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure despite maximal support with pressor agents including phenylephrine , norepinephrine , epinephrine , and dopamine .
The patient continued to require transfusions .
The patient &apos;s oxygenation became increasingly difficult , as the chest X-rays demonstrated marked pulmonary edema .
The ventilator settings demonstrated elevating peak inspiratory pressures up to 75 millimeters .
The urine output dropped dramatically , and the patient was treated with Lasix and Mannitol for an attempt at forced diuresis .
As the patient &apos;s hemodynamic parameters demonstrated a narrow pulse pressure and rapidly elevated pulmonary artery pressures , the decision was made to perform echocardiogram to rule out potential paracardial tamponade .
The study was considered to be inadequate , and it was unable definitively rule out the presence of such tamponade .
Despite maximal support with pressor agents , mechanical ventilation , and ongoing transfusion with fresh frozen plasma and packed red blood cells , and a Protamine for treatment of the coagulopathy , the patient continued to demonstrate declining blood pressure , and subsequently expired with a cessation of heart rate and blood pressure at 11:20 p.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7-29</PHI>-94 .
At this point , the mechanical ventilator was turned off .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient expired .

His lungs are clear .
His abdomen is soft and non tenderwith no masses .
He has bounding pulsatile aorta that appeared enlarged .
Hisrectal examination is negative with no masses and an enlarged prostate , guaiac negative , non tender .
Lower extremities :
he has varicosities of theright leg from the knee down to the ankle .
His right groin has a small hematoma with a good right femoral pulse with an associated bruit .
His pulses are 2+ bilaterally throughout .
IMPRESSION ;
A 67 year old white male with increasing mental status changes who was found to have an aortic root aneurysm upon work up .
He is scheduled to undergo a composite aortic root replacement .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/11</PHI>/96 .
He was seen by the dental service preoperatively who cleared him for surgery , as he had no evidence of acute oral infection .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/12</PHI>/96 the patient was taken to the operating room where he underwent a composite aortic root replacement .
postoperatively , he was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit .
he was given Vancomycin IV for perioperative prophylactic antibiotics .
By postoperative day 1 he was extubated and was stable enough for discharge to the regular floor .
He was placed on Coumadin postoperatively as well as digoxin and Lopressor .
His mental status changes remained stable from their perioperative baseline and he was continued on his Haldol .
He was in atrial fibrillation postoperatively but his rate was well controlled on digoxin and Lopressor .
His chest tubes were all removed by postoperative day 3 .
He was placed on Coumadin given the presence of the persistent atrial fibrillation and it is thought that he would only need short term anticoagulation for approximately 3 months .
By postoperative day 7 the patient was stable enough for discharge to home .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DOCTOR &apos;S DISCHARGE ORDERS :
The patient will follow up at the anti-coagulation clinic for his Coumadin follow up .
He will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rhalt</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Em</PHI> .
He will be visited by home <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sini Memorial Hospital</PHI> services .
His medications on discharge include digoxin 0.375 mg PO QD , Lopressor 75 mg PO BID , Coumadin to attain an INR of 1.8 to 2 , Haldol 0.5 mg Po BID and Prednisolone 0.12% OU QD .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
PERIPHERAL VASCULAR DISEASE .
OPERATIONS / PROCEDURES :
FEMOROPOPLITEAL BYPASS ON <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-28</PHI>-90 , BY DR. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">RISHAN THOREGORB</PHI> .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is well known to the Chief Service and was recently discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-13</PHI>-90 .
Her original admission was for an ischemic left foot .
History reveals a 72 year old woman with multiple medical problems including chronic atrial fibrillation , congestive heart failure , polyarticular gouty arthritis , who is confined to a wheelchair .
She has peripheral vascular disease and ischemic left foot , for which she was admitted and underwent angiography and angioplasty on her previous admission , which was from <PHI TYPE="DATE">6-6</PHI>-90 to <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-13</PHI>-90 .
She had angioplasty of her left external iliac and proximal distal superficial femoral artery .
She returns for a progressively ischemic left foot .
She was admitted to the Service on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-25</PHI>-90 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION include .0675 of digoxin a day , prednisone 15 milligrams per day , Capoten 6.25 milligrams a day , Pepcid 20milligrams a day , cardizem 90 milligrams each morning .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Her examination is remarkable for a Cushingoid-appearing woman in no acute distress with multiple ecchymoses over her body .
She has obvious deformities of her joints from her arthritic condition .
She has brisk upstrokes in the carotids without any bruits .
Lungs are clear .
Heart has normal rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs or gallops .
She has a colostomy on the left side that is healthy .
Extremities are remarkable for deformities secondary to arthritis with a swan deformity of her fingers .
Her pulses are carotids II+ bilaterally , radial pulses II+ bilaterally , right leg has II+ femoral , I+ dorsalis pedis and I+ posterior tibialis .
On the left side , she has no pulses below her femoral pulses .
On her left foot , her first , third and fourth toes are black with gangrene and there is an area of hyperemia just proximal to that .
She also has a ulcer on the left heel .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
On admission , laboratory data were unremarkable and within normal limits , except for creatinine 1.6. Hematocrit on admission was 34.8 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and had preoperative evaluation .
She was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">06-27</PHI>-90 , and underwent a left femoral to below-the-knee popliteal in situ graft using the saphenous vein .
The patient underwent the procedure without any complications and returned to her room .
Her hospital course was unremarkable .
Of note is the fact that her left leg was quite edematous postoperatively , likely due to the fact that her lymphatic system was interrupted and she had likely a venous thrombosis which is old in the left deep veins .
Her wound weeped serosanguinous fluid and was treated with dressing changes .
By the time of her discharge , her wound was significantly drier and she went home with dry sterile dressing changes only toher groin area .
She went home with staples intact due to the fact that she has poor wound healing secondary to chronic steroid use .
The patient had a Dopplerable dorsalis pedis pulse her entire hospitalization and her foot was warm .
There always remained asmall area of erythema in her forefoot , however , this was markedly improved .
Her gangrene stayed dry the whole time and she wastreated with 5 days of triple antibiotics .
During the hospitalization , the patient did develop a small flare in herarthritis , for which her rheumatologist was consulted and they increased her steroids for approximately 3 days .
The patient did well .
DISPOSITION :
The patient was discharged to home , to FOLLOW-UP with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Thoregorb</PHI> .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE include digoxin .0625 a day , prednisone 50 milligrams a day , cardizem 30 milligrams 3 times a day , K-Dur 20 milligrams a day .
The patient has her own visiting nurse and she will see to any wound care .

This is a 51-year-old woman with a complexvascular operative history including , in 1990 , lower extremity bypasses and an aorto-bifem .
In 1992 right carotid endarterectomy for symptomatic stenosis .
In 1992 left carotid endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis .
Some time in early 1993 re-do right carotid endarterectomy and in 1995 aorto , in nominate and left common carotid bypass graft with a 14 X 7 bifurcated Dacron graft .
She is now back with recurrent symptoms consisting of left arm and leg weakness with shaking , as well as transient episodes of amaurosis fugax in her right eye .
She is to undergo angiography and then perhaps , if amenable , a surgical procedure .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Crohn &apos;s disease .
She has had multiple bowel resections .
Lumbar disc disease .

She doesn &apos;t drink alcohol .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is divorced and lives with a roommate in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Tjay St. , Wa , Missouri 74493</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Temperature 97.8 , pulse 86 , blood pressure 120/70 .
Sclerae anicteric .
Symmetric face .
Neck :
bilateral bruits , very diminished right carotid pulse if any , and a brisk left carotid pulse .
Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally with median sternotomy scar .
Heart regular rate and rhythm without a murmur .
The abdomen is soft without bruit .
Multiple midline scars .
No organomegaly .
GU :
Normal female .
Rectal guaiac negative .
Multiple external hemorrhoids .
Normal tone .
Nomasses .
Pulses are :
radial-left trace , right 2+ ; brachial-left 1+ , right 2+ ; femoral 2+ bilaterally ; popliteal 2+ bilaterally ; dorsalispedis 2+ bilaterally ; posterior tibial 2+ bilaterally .
ASSESSMENT :
Complicated patient who has continued smoking for her extensive peripheral vascular disease history .
She now has possibly quit cigarettes , but has renewed symptoms of right carotid disease .
She is to undergo an angiogram when her coagulation profile allows .
She has been on Coumadin .
We will check her coags before heparinizing , and she will go to angiography when her prothrombin time comes within an acceptable range .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Tomedankell Flowayles</PHI> of Cardiology who recommended that , if she were to undergo an operative procedure , that she first have a coronary perfusion scan .
The patient was also seen by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Breutz</PHI> of the GI Service who assessed her as not needing colonoscopy or a GI series at this time .
She was also seen by the Stroke Service who noted that a recent magnetic resonance angiogram had reportedly shown a right common carotid artery occlusion .
They also noted that a careful elicitation of her visual symptoms seemed possibly consistent more with migraine than with ischemia .
They recommended that she have a baseline head computerized tomographyscan , agreed with obtaining an angiogram and recommended trying a trial of migraine therapy to see if ocular symptoms resolved .
Meanwhile the patient was heparinized .
Her prothrombin time came down and , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/15</PHI>/96 , she underwent angiography .
This showed :
1. a patent aorto innominate left common carotid graft .
2. an occluded right common carotid artery , right internal carotid and reconstitution of a short segment of right external carotid from the left vertebral .
3. a mild stenosis of the right proximal subclavian artery .
4. mild stenosis of the right vertebral origin .
5. apatent left common carotid , left internal carotid , status post left carotid endarterectomy .
6. an occluded left external carotid .
7. a patent left subclavian proximally , occluded left axillary artery with reconstitution ofthe left brachial artery .
8. moderate to severe stenosis of the left vertebral origin .
9. right cerebral hemisphere fills from the left vertebral and the left internal carotid .
Given these angiographic findings , which were not amenable to surgery , the patient was weaned from heparin , restarted on Coumadin , and was discharged today , <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/18</PHI>/96 , with therapeutic protime .
In retrospect , her symptoms may have been surrounding the final thrombosis of her right carotid .
A perfusion scan was not necessary as no surgical procedure was entertained .
An I-head computerized tomography scan done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/96 showed two areas of old infarction without evidence of a recent infarct or bleed .
Both the old infarcts were in the right hemisphere , # 1 in the frontal lobe nad # 2 around the centrum semi ovale .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
The patient was discharged home in good condition .
FOLLOW UP :
She will follow up with her local doctor &apos;s Coumadin clinic .

CHIEF COMPLAINT :
The patient was transferred from an outside hospital for a second opinion regarding workup of his pancreatic cancer .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :

In general , this is an obese male in mild respiratory distress .
Neck was supple with no lymphadenopathy .

LABORATORY DATA :
White blood count 4.36 , hematocrit 26.1 with platelets of 107,000 , MCV 81 .
Sodium 137 , potassium 4.5 , chloride97 , bicarb 24 , BUN 124 , creatinine 4.1 , glucose 144 , AST 49 , ALT33 , alkaline phosphatase 253 , total bili 1.6 , calcium 9.2 , magnesium 2.3 , albumin 3.4 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Gastrointestinal .
The patient had an elevated bilirubin on admission with decreased output of biliary drain .
The drain was replaced over the wire , 8-10 by IR , when it was accidentally removed .
Increased flow again .
The patient had signs and symptoms develop of SBP , also with an elevated white count .
He was treated broadly with amp , levo and Flagyl .
Cultures were negative and onlyon one gram stain did it show rare gram negative rods .
The patient &apos;s abdominal fluid cell counts showed 2400 white blood cells , 500 red cells with 82 polyps , 11 lymphs , 7 monos .
Clinically , this was consistent with SBP , although unfortunately , fluid was never sent for cytology and a lot of those white cells are most likely due to his cancer .
He underwent abdominal paracentesis approximately two times a week for therapeutic .
This had to be performed by IR because the pocket was too deep to access from the bedside .
He received a two week course of broad spectrum antibiotics and will be maintained on Levofloxacin IV for prophylaxis against SBP .
2. Pulmonary .
From a pulmonary standpoint , he continued to complain of shortness of breath .
His apical pneumothorax from the outside hospital had resolved .
Chest xray was consistent with pleurodesis .
However , with persistent abdomen distention , there is likely restrictive deficit and , in addition , after each tap , he at times became hypotensive and with some mild fluid resuscitation decompensated with pulmonary edema , requiring both albumin and Lasix to try to mobilize third space fluids .
On the day of discharge , he is stating approximately 91 to 92% on three to four liters .
Chest xray is still consistent with volume overload .
The plan will be to continue to try to alternate albumin and Lasix to mobilize his fluid .
3. Cardiovascular .
He had episodes of bradycardia without subsequent fall in blood pressure at the beginning of his admission .
He was ruled out for a myocardial infarction .
Echocardiogram showed 50% ejection fraction with mild mitral regurgitation .
He did not show any episodes of bradycardia throughout the remainder of his hospital course .
4. Endocrine .
Diabetes .
His Avandia was discontinued secondary to the side effect profile .
He is being maintained on glipizide and sliding scale insulin .
5. Heme .
From a heme standpoint , he presented anemic and with an elevated PT INR .
He required a few transfusions during his hospital course .
He also required FFP initially to reverse his coagulopathy .
However , this resolved on its own over the hospital course .
His INR normalized , however , unfortunately , he developed bilateral deep venous thromboses during his hospital course and will be maintained on Lovenox .
6. Renal .
He had a creatinine of 4.0 on admission and this decreased down to the mid ones with fluid , currently at 1.7 on discharge .
From his urinalysis , he has mostly a prerenal state .
However , he does require diuresis to prevent increased volume overload in his lungs from his hypoalbunemic state .
At the time , Nutrition was following , initially with a low fat , low cholesterol , low sugar diet .
His appetite is decreasing somewhat as his disease process progresses , therefore , we have liberalized his diet for him to take what he wishes .
7. ID .
Please see GI .
He was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics for a 14 day course for clinical SBP .
He will be maintained on Levofloxacin for prophylaxis against SBP .
Given that he will need continued taps,
8. Oncology .
The patient initially came for workup of pancreatic cancer with a questions of palliative chemotherapy .
However , given his rapid clinical decline , this was deferred and I do not suspect that he will be a candidate for this , as the degree of his decline bodes a poor prognosis for him .
His pain here has been controlled , initially on Oxycontin with morphine for breakthrough pain .
As he becomes progressively more somnolent , this will likely need to be switched to IV pain medications only .
Discussion , at that point in time , should occur with the family about comfort measures and about weaning him from his medications to make him more comfortable .
Code status - the patient is a DNR / DNI .
This is an unfortunate case but Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Po</PHI> does have an incredibly supportive family who have been here consistently to visit him and that offers him an important source of comfort .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Tylenol , 650 mg p.o. q 4 prn ; Allopurinol , 100 mg p.o. q.d. ; Peridex mouthwash , 10 ml b.i.d.; cholysteramineresin , 4 grams p.o. q.d. ; clotrimazole , one troche p.o. q.i.d. ; Fentanyl patch , 100 mcg per hour topical q 72 hours ; glipizide , 10 mg p.o. q.d.; Atarax , 25 operating table 50 mg p.o. q 6 to 8 hours prn itching ; regular sliding scale insulin ; KBL mouthwash , 15 ccp .o. q.d. prn mouth discomfort ; Lactulose , 30 ml p.o. q.i.d. that was started on <PHI TYPE="DATE">January 30</PHI> , for no bowel movements with instructions to continue until bowel movement and then decrease to b.i.d. or q.d. ; Lidocaine , 2% , 10 ml UR q 3 to 4 hours prn for pain around Foley site ; Ativan , 0.25 to 0.5 mg IV q 4 to 6 hours prn anxiety with instructions to use caution .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 76 year old white female who was transferred from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Oneoremadi Ryviewmawpa Greecounbci</PHI> with severe coronary artery disease and presented for coronary artery bypass grafting .
The patient overall had been in her usual state of good health until three to four months prior when she developed progressively worsening chest pain exacerbated bystress .
In retrospect she has had several years of rare episodes of chest pain attributed to indigestion .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/14</PHI>/94 she underwent a Persantine-thallium test at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center</PHI> which showed anterolateralischemia and she also developed chest pain during her study .
She was admitted for cardiac catheterization which on transfer today showed severe left main disease with occluded right coronary artery and 95 percent stenosis of the circumflex with severe proximal left anterior descending .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">TGCHO</PHI> for surgical evaluation and was stable throughout except for some chest pain during her cardiac catheterization relieved with morphine and intravenous nitroglycerin .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is above above , as well as ( 2 ) non-insulin diabetes mellitus which she is controlled on oral hypoglycemics , and ( 3 ) hypertension .
ALLERGIES :
None .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :

SOCIAL HISTORY :
No alcohol use and quit tobacco greater than 25 years ago with a 10-pack year smoking history .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The vital signs were stable .
She was a pleasant obese white female in no acute distress .
HEENT examination was within normal limits ; neck was without adenopathy , lungs were clear to auscultation and percussion ; heart regular rate and rhythm with distant heart sounds .
Abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
without deformities or varicosities .
Vascular showed 2 plus pulses except for her dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses which were one plus .
She had a left carotid bruit .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Given the patient &apos;s severe three vessel coronary artery disease a Cardiac Surgery consult was obtained for possible coronary artery bypass grafting .
She was kept on intravenous heparin , nitroglycerin and beta blockade .
Regarding her carotid bruit a carotid non-invasive study was obtained which showed severe right internal carotid artery stenosis and moderate left internal carotid artery stenosis .
In conjunction with the cardiac surgeons Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ausguall</PHI> from the Vascular Surgery Service was consulted for carotid endarterectomy on the right .
In anticipation of her endarterectomy she underwent an MRA angiogram on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/22</PHI>/94 .

Due to this result an urgent carotid endarterectomy along with her coronary artery bypass graft was performed on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/25</PHI>/94 .
There were no complications and postoperatively she was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit in stable condition .
She remained neurologically intact and did well from the Vascular Surgery stand point .
Her Intensive Care Unit stay was only notable for an increase in chest tube output which subsequently decreased and was removed prior to her transfer to the floor .
She had some ectopy , specifically frequent ectopic activity after her surgery for which a Cardiac Arrhythmia Service consult was obtained and she was put on a Holter monitor and echocardiogram was obtained .
She remained hemodynamically stable and wires were kept intact beyond postoperative day four since she had some evidence of heart block .
Her beta blocker was held and she continued to be in sinus rhythm versus atrial fibrillation with frequent premature ventricular contractions .
Echocardiogram revealed her left ventricle to be within normal limits and otherwise her study was negative .
Holter monitor results were pending at the time of discharge .
Wires were subsequently discontinued and her digoxin and beta blocker were discontinued .
Otherwise her hospital course was uneventful .

Paramedics were called and found him to have a blood pressure of 120/80 , a pulse of 92 , breathing at 16 and normally cognizant .
During transport to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room , he vomited an additional 200 cc. of dark , red blood .
In the emergency department , an NG-tube was placed and additional dark blood was suctioned .
He subsequently was lavaged to clear but had a repeat of hematemesis prompting urgent endoscopy .
On endoscopy , he was found to have Grade III varices without active bleeding in the lower one-third of the esophagus that had &quot; stigmata of bleeding and red signs . &quot;
He had additional varices in a hiatal hernia .
In total , five bands were placed .
Gastric varices were also found and there was blood in the body of the stomach .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout with blood pressures in the 150 &apos;s and heart rate in the 90 &apos;s .
There were no orthostatics , unfortunately , done .
The patient was diagnosed with hepatitis C several years ago .
He has had blood transfusions in the past but denies all intravenous drug abuse .
He has a history of alcoholism that dates back approximately 60 years , but ended 7 years ago .
He says that during the period of his alcoholism he drank &quot; As much as I could . &quot;
In <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> of 1998 , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Kote</PHI> underwent evaluation for expanding abdominal girth , nausea and vomiting .
A CT scan of the abdomen at that time revealed multiple lesions on the liver .
On needle biopsy , these lesions were found to be hepatocellular carcinoma .
His AFB at that time was 251 .
He did not undergo curative or palliative treatment at that time .
He is not a candidate for liver transplant because of his age .
At that time , he was started on Lasix and Aldactone .
Until 2 months ago , the patient had done remarkably well until he noticed an increasing abdominal girth .
He was evaluated by his primary care physician who found that he had gained 15 pounds and referred him to Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lierm</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Rose-tedmargpark Medical Center</PHI> for diagnosis and therapeutic paracentesis , which he underwent on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 12</PHI> , 1998 .
Approximately 2 liters of clear ascitic fluid were drained at that time .
Cell counts were negative for SBP and cultures have been negative to date .
He had not had and continues not to have any episodes of fever .
He complains of right upper quadrant pain that began shortly after his paracentesis 4 days ago .
He has not had any anorexia and continues to take his outpatient medications .

His EKG had normal axis , normal intervals , no LVH or RVH , tiny Q &apos;s in V3 through V6 , no T wave inversions or other indications of acute ischemia .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Our impression was this was a 73 year old man with cirrhosis , portal hypertension , hepatocellular carcinoma , hepatitis C , history of alcoholism in the past , history of peptic ulcer disease on aspirin without acid blockade who presented with an upper GI bleed with multiple esophageal and gastric varices .
His portal hypertension resulting in a ruptured varices was almost certainly his cause of bleed .
There was no evidence of ulcers on endoscopy .
His bleed also might have been precipitated by med non-compliance versus other causes of increased blood pressure such as increased salt intake .
The temporal proximity to paracentesis was initially worrisome for an underlying infection without precipitating hemodynamic imbalance , although no evidence of infection was established with any sputum , paracentesis culture or blood culture .
Given the extent of hepatocellular carcinoma diagnosis of cancer , the risk of worsening obstruction to portal venous flow versus ____________ was also increased .
He was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit while his initial care that first night was , by system :
Neurologically , given the risk of hepatic encephalopathy with the recent GI bleed , he was put on lactulose 30 cc. PO titrated to 4 loose stools per day .
Cardiovascularly , he was hypertensive by report on admission and TNG drip , Lasix , Aldactone and propranolol was instigated to keep his systolic blood pressure between 100 and 120 .
Rhythm wise , he was in normal sinus rhythm , no issues .
His PR interval was watched as propranolol was started .
There was no evidence of ischemia .
Pulmonary wise , he had some wheezing on exam .
He was treated with inhalers .
There was a suggestion of pneumonia on exam , but not on chest x-ray .
GI wise , he underwent status post banding x 5 for bleeding esophageal varices .
He was kept NPO .
He was started originally on propranolol and then switched to metoprolol as he experienced some wheezing in order to decrease his portal pressure .
He was also started on triatide , omeprazole .
In terms of Hem wise , he had experienced an approximately 12 point crit drop with this bleed .
For this , he was given 6 units of FFP , 4 units of packed red blood cells and platelets were kept greater than 60 with transfusion of platelets .
He was also given Vitamin K 10 mg. PO x 3 days .
He was treated with Pneumoboots for DVT prophylaxis .
He was kept in the Medical Intensive Care Unit for 24 hours during which time , his hematocrit remained stable and he had no other signs of continued GI bleed .
At that point , he was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Carespistown Hospital</PHI> for further management .
On his second day of admission , there was a concern about a developing pneumonia based on a worsening lung exam and also worsening cough , although sputum and all blood cultures remained negative for pathogens and the patient did not have a temperature spike .
Despite this , he was started on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 18th</PHI> as well as Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID for the possibility of an emerging aspiration pneumonia .
The major therapeutic concern on the floor was diuresis .
His Aldactone was gradually titrated up to a maximum dose of 400 mg. per day divided in three even doses .
In addition , Lasix was added on to help him with diuresis .
Between <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 20th</PHI> and <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 25th</PHI> , he lost approximately 7 pounds on this regimen .
However , after Lasix was added back on , his creatinine rose from approximately 1.4 up to 1.7 and Lasix was held for 24 hours .
At that time , a dose of 20 mg. IV BID was re-instigated .
On the 400 mg. of Aldactone , his potassium remained in the high normal range around 5.0 .
Therefore , on <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 25th</PHI> , his Aldactone was decreased to 100 mg. PO TID and Lasix was kept at 20 mg. BID .
On this regimen , his weight remained approximately stable .
He was also kept on a low salt diet .
He was also kept on a 2 liter per day fluid restriction .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 26</PHI> , 1998 , he was ready to discharged back to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center</PHI> , although he would stay in the Medical Unit there before returning back to his own room .
At discharge , the active issues still to be dealt with at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center</PHI> are :
1. Necessity of daily electrolytes and creatinine monitoring as his diuretic regimen was optimized .
At discharge , he was on 100 mg. Aldactone TID and 20 mg. of Lasix BID but with potassium running in the high normal range necessitating daily electrolyte checks while the exact ratio of Lasix to Aldactone was optimized .
2. He also needs daily weight checks and daily abdominal exam to evaluate his fluid status .
3. He also needs TID fingerstick glucose to monitor his blood sugar .
4. In terms of his antibiotics , he has 4 days left of his Flagyl 500 mg. q8hours .
For SBP prophylaxis , he should be left indefinitely on Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
5. He should be enforced on a no concentrated sugars , low salt diet .
6. He also should have a 2 liter fluid restriction , if possible .
7. He should have initially twice a week checks of his hematocrit to make sure that his GI bleeding has stabilized .
FOLLOW UP :
1. He will follow up with his primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Portal</PHI> , at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center</PHI> .
Doctor <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Portal</PHI> has been notified of the patient &apos;s progress at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> .
2. From our GI Service , the patient will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Shufftakeaakote</PHI> and follow up will be arranged in GI Clinic for next week .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
1. Prilosec 20 mg. PO BID .
2. Zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO QD .
3. Isordil 10 mg. PO TID .
4. Lopressor 12.5 mg. PO BID .
5. Levoflox 250 mg. PO QD .
6. Atrovent nebs q8hours .
7. Flagyl 500 mg. IV TID to stop on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/1998 .
8. Albuterol q4hour nebulizer treatments .
9. Lactulose 30 cc. PO BID .
10. Aldactone 100 mg. PO TID titrated to potassium .
11. Lasix 20 mg. PO BID .
12. NPH Insulin 14 units subq in the morning , 10 units subq in the evening as well as additional CZI Insulin based on TID fingersticks .
ADDENDUM :
Unfortunately patient could not be discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/28</PHI>/98 because , in the context of starting his Lasix , his creatinine bumped overnight from 1.7 to 2.2 , possibly because of a progression of his hepatorenal syndrome .
His potassium also climbed to 5.1 .
Because of this , we held all of his diuretics , namely his Lasix and Aldactone .
Despite holding his Aldactone , his potassium continued to rise over the course of the next two days .
It went as high as 5.8 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/29</PHI>/98 .
He was treated with Kayexalate b.i.d. 30 gm. as treatment for this .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/98 his potassium had gone down to 4.0 .
We then restarted a much smaller dose of Aldactoneat 50 mg. PO Q day .
This was the dose of Aldactone he had originally been admitted with .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/31</PHI>/98 the junior resident on <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Drugway Hospital</PHI> , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Asaleysean Portal</PHI> , had an extensive conversation with the patient about his future medical care .
Patient was very clear that he did not want any extraordinary measures done in case of acute illness .
Specifically he did not want to be intubated or have any of the ACLS protocol in the case of acardiac or pulmonary arrest .
He also was very adamant that if he was to rapidly GI bleed , as from an esophageal bleed , that he did not want any extraordinary measures taken .
Specifically he did not want to be re-banded .
We also addressed the possibility of having the GI service re-endoscope him in a few weeks to look at the progression of his esophageal banding .
He said that he did not feel that that made any sense given his other comorbid disease .
The patient was very adamant that in the future he would prefer to stay at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital</PHI> where he is in residence .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Asaleysean Portal</PHI> spoke with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fat</PHI> of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ant Sonroeinland Medical Center</PHI> about this and that residence will make it clear that patient is not to be transferred back to an acute care facility in the case of decompensation .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
lactulose 30 cc &apos;s PO b.i.d. , Prilosec 20 mg. PO b.i.d. , zinc sulfate 220 mg. PO Q day , Isordil 10 mg. PO t.i.d. , Metoprolol 12.5 mg. PO b.i.d. , Levofloxacin 250 mg. PO Q day , Atrovent nebs Q8 hours , Albuterol nebs Q8 hours , and Flagyl 500 mg. IV Q8 hours with the last day <PHI TYPE="DATE">4/1</PHI>/98 .
Patient will need no further antibiotics in his nursing home .
He was also on Aldactone 50 mg. PO Q day .
We decided to discontinue his Lasixas this had resulted in increase in his creatinine .
At the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital</PHI> he will need daily weights as well as daily lytes , specifically potassium , BUN and creatinine to make sure that he can safely tolerate this dose of Aldactone .
He should also have a low salt , low potassium diet without concentrated sweets and 2 liter fluid restriction .
He will also need t.i.d. fingerstick glucose and he will follow up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Fat</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Southnyra Erwill*te Cinee Memorial Hospital</PHI> .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
ventricular tachycardia .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
coronary artery disease , hypertension .
SPECIAL PROCEDURES AND OPERATIONS :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3-17</PHI>-94 , implantation of an automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator .
OTHER PROCEDURES :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">3-11</PHI>-94 , right heart cardiac catheterization with comprehensive electrophysiology study and radio frequency ablation for ventricular tachycardia .
DOCTORS DISCHARGE ORDERS :
Zestril 5 mg PO q.day , Nitropatch .2 mg once daily , Sotalol 120 mg PO b.i.d. , Lasix 20 mg PO b.i.d. , Coumadin as directed .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .
He had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .
He presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in <PHI TYPE="DATE">December</PHI> , 1994 and was admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> .
The coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .
An echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .
He had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .
After the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .
The patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 8</PHI> , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .
The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Xingwa Moineswest</PHI> where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .
The tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .
The patient was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital</PHI> for further evaluation .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
The past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .
His blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .
The carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .
The jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .
Lung examination revealed crackling rales over the bases of both lungs .
Cardiovascular exam :
normal Sl and S2 .
The abdomen was benign .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
LABORATORY DATA :
The chest X-ray showed mild cardiomegaly .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .
The patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .
Intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 11</PHI> , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .
During the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .
Pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .
After mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .
After radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .
However , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .
Since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .
The patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 17</PHI> , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .
Then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .
The defibrillation threshold was less than or equal to 20 joules on several consecutive attempts .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was uneventful .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 19</PHI> , the patient was taken back to the Electrophysiology Laboratory where noninvasive programmed stimulation and automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator testing were performed .
Under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .
This was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .
Three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .
For tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .
For tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .
For tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .
VVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .
The patient felt good on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">March 20</PHI> .
The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .
He will have his prothrombin time checked on Monday and will follow up with the Defibrillator Clinic .

<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">LENNI EENAHILDE BREUTZOLN</PHI> MD , PHD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
Perirectal abscess and myelodysplastic syndrome .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This is a 67-year-old female with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome subtype and refractory anemia with excess of blasts in transformation .
She was admitted for perirectal pain and fever .
HISTORY BRIEFLY AS FOLLOWS :
History of MDS diagnosed in <PHI TYPE="DATE">June</PHI> 2002 .
At that time was evidence of disease progression with 22% blast , which led to treatment with five azacitidine on compassionate use basis starting in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> 2003 .
On admission , she was status post three cycles of chemotherapy .
Her course have been complicated by perirectal pain and thrombosed hemorrhoids .
After her third cycle of chemotherapy , the patient noted worsening of her rectal pain along with fever and chills .
CT done as an outpatient showed inflammation and hemorrhoids but no obvious abscess .
The patient continues with rectal pain and fevers and eventually went to an outside hospital <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lichampm Kane Ancester Medical Center</PHI> where CT scan revealed a tiny area on the right consistent with hemorrhoids versus a tiny perirectal abscess as said initially , but the pain was secondary to hemorrhoids and anal fissure and local care was provided .
The patient &apos;s status worsened with continued elevated temperatures to 103 and increase in rectal pain .
The patient noted a yellowish drainage from the rectum .
The patient was then transferred on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/14</PHI>/03 to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Gaanvantsir</PHI> due to her high-risk status .
Review of the CT scan from an outside hospital likely perirectal abscess given the CT was limited by not having IV ororal contrast .
The patient reports on admission having yellowish drainage from rectum occasionally pink , but no frank blood .
The stools were soft but formed .
Although , initially she has had constipation after starting chemotherapy .
She noted also nausea , decreased appetite , and decreased p.o. intake .
Also of note , on admission , she had increased urinary frequency but no difficulty urinating .
No weakness .
No abdominal pain .
Her temperature was elevated to 103 , but her blood pressure had been stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
1. From an infectious disease standpoint , she has a perirectal abscess .
Ceptaz and Flagyl were both started .
Blood cultures were done each morning for the first week with no growth during her hospitalization and her urinalysis and cultures were negative .
Surgery here saw the patient on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/15</PHI>/03 and they did an incision and drainage of her perirectal abscess and recommended daily sitz bath and also recommended increasing her p.o. water and fiber intake over the following two days , although the patient developed a rectal fistula for which surgery again had to be called .
They placed the drain and continued to follow the patient .
The patient continued to spike temperatures with perirectal pain after surgery and the Nasalide was added to her antibiotic regimen to cover for enterococcus and MRSA given the patient &apos;s resistence to ampicillin B and her history of vancomycin-resistant enterococcus .
The patient spiked only once after beginning with Nasalide and had been afebrile for six days before discharge .
About three days of discharge , her PICC site became inflamed , but the patient remained stable and afebrile .
Her PICC line was pulled and the patient was switched off oral antibiotics .
She remained stable and afebrile for two days before being discharged and after starting her p.o. antibiotics .
From pain perspective , we used OxyContin and oxycodone , which was titrated up during her hospitalization to maximize pain control and for ease of bathroom use .
2. From diet perspective FEN , she was hyponatremic on admission , which was secondary to her dehydration and resolved with hydration .
Her nutritional status is poor on admission with low albumin and an elevated INR .
She was given vitamin K and Nutrition was consulted .
With supplements and multivitamins and encouragement , the patient improved and had increased liquid and solid intake prior to discharge .
3. Cardiovascular wise , the patient has history of hypertension , although blood pressure was not elevated during her hospitalization and hydrochlorothiazide she had on admission was discontinued .
4. Rheumatalogically , the patient has history of rheumatoid arthritis .
She was on 1 mg of prednisone every other day , which was tapered and discontinued .
This patient had no episodes of rheumatic pain .
5. From psychosocial plans perspective , the patient lives with her sister in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Pupeake Su Park</PHI> and was discharged to her sister &apos;s care with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">SMH</PHI> services for continued home care .
6. From Hematology / Oncology perspective , although the patient did not undergo any chemotherapy during this hospitalization .
Bone marrow biopsy was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">7/17</PHI>/03 and the results were pending at the time of discharge .
The patient will follow up with her oncologist for her final results and for further treatment .
6. From genitourinary perspective , the patient complained of difficulty urinating .
She was started on Ditropan and that was suggested to optimize relief of symptoms .
On discharge , the patient had fewer complaints of difficulty starting her urine and upon discharge is to follow up with her PCP for further treatment .
The patient was advised at discharge to eat high fiber and plenty of fluids to do sitz baths five times daily .
She was scheduled for surgical follow up and was advised to call her PCP for fever , chills , worsening rectal pain , or increased rectal drainage .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :

There were no complications of his admission .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY PROBLEM :
Problem number 1 , multiple myeloma .
The patient was re-staged during his admission with a urine and serum electroimmunophoresis and a full skeletal survey .
He also received a four-day Decadron burst .
The patient had pain in the L3 distribution .
His MRI of the spine showed no clear reason for the pain and thus , a pelvic CT was obtained showing a large right pelvic mass that likely was causing his leg pain .
Radiation oncology was scheduled for next Tuesday to irradiate the mass .
Urinary retention .
Although there was a T5 compression fracture compressing the cord without signal change , there was no evidence that this lesion could be causing his urinary retention ; and it was felt that the pelvic mass more likely accounted for his urinary retention .
Fevers .
His blood and urine cultures were obtained and remained negative throughout admission .
His chest X-ray did not reveal source of his fevers .
The patient was placed on Levaquin .
Shortness of breath .
The patient had a V-Q scan on admission that was low probability for PE .
The patient had no evidence of acute pulmonary embolus and his shortness of breath resolved over the course of his admission .
The patient had a T5 compression fracture with cord deformity .
Neurosurgery was consulted .

DISCHARGE DATE :
<PHI TYPE="DATE">01/08</PHI>/2004
The patient has a known history of pancreatic adenocarcinoma .
He is admitted at this time because of significant GI bleeding .
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :
Significant for fatigue and increased abdominal discomfort .
MEDICATIONS AT THE TIME OF ADMISSION :
Insulin , Celexa , Protonix , Ambien and Pancreas .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs showed his blood pressure to be slightly decreased at 120/60 , pulse 64 , respirations 16 , temperature 98.8 , O2 sat 95 .
HEENT :
Evidence of anemia with being pale , but anicteric , no oral lesions .
Neck supple .
Lungs clear .
Back without CVA or spinal tenderness .
Heart regular rate and rhythm .
Abdomen :
Bowel sounds positive , soft , mildly tender in the epigastrium without hepatosplenomegaly , mass or tenderness .
Extremities :
Trace edema without cyanosis or clubbing .
His hematocrit at the time of admission was 20.5 , after having been 32 one week earlier .
ASSESSMENT :
The assessment was that he had a GI bleed .
He was transfused and then evaluated by GI .
Endoscopy showed multiple angio ectasias throughout the stomach .
He received multiple treatments for this over the succeeding weeks .
In addition , he was transfused .
His platelet count was maintained with platelet transfusion as necessary .
He was treated with Octreotide to try to slow down the bleeding .
Despite all these measures , his bleeding was never totally controlled .
He then had an angiogram with Gel foam to try to control his GI bleed .
Again , this was unsuccessful .
At that point he had a change in mental status and was no longer responsive .
Given this , the decision was made to make his care comfort measures only .
At this point , he was made comfort measures and expired comfortably .
The cause of death was a combination of GI bleeding felt to be ultimately related to his known metastatic pancreatic cancer .

BRIEF HISTORY :
She is a 57-year-old chronic dialysis patient who was admitted with an occluded right forearm dialysis AV graft and hyperkalemia .
The patient underwent dialysis AV graft thrombectomy and this was complicated by poor result due to stenosis and fibrosed nature of graft .
She subsequently had swelling of her left arm and ongoing hyperkalemia which was managed with Kayexalate .
She was admitted to reestablish dialysis angio access and to optimize dialysis indices .
PREVIOUS HISTORY :
1. Endstage renal disease due to polycystic kidney disease status post failed transplant on chronic hemodialysis at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> .
2. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
3. Restless leg syndrome .

ADMISSION LABORATORY DATA :
Potassium 6.3 down to 4.8 , calcium 8.3 , phosphorus 5 .
BUN 35 , creatinine 5.9 , hematocrit 34.9 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. Dialysis :
She received dialysis via a remnant of her AV graft but clearance was suboptimal and graft will not be usable over the long-term .
She was therefore referred for a dialysis tunneled angiocatheter and will be seen by the surgical service as an outpatient for elective revision of her AV graft surgically .
Her potassium was stable postdialysis in the 4 range .
Her hematocrit was however low and with followup pending .
The patient has chronic outpatient dialysis at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> and communication regarding her angio access status will be performed .
2. Cardiovascular :
The patient has a history of ischemic heart disease .
She had labile blood pressure following dialysis likely related to fluid removal and then sedating medications for catheter placement .
She resolved spontaneously with small fluid bolus and with no further difficulties .
3. Metabolic :
Hyperkalemia as noted .
Now stable with reestablishment of vascular access .
Anemia :
Probably a component of CKD , dilutional and blood loss with procedures .
Pending reevaluation will be monitored in an outpatient setting .
Increase dose of EPO .
No need for transfusion at this stage given the patient is asymptomatic and no episodes of GI bleeding documented .
The patient will follow up with her primary nephrologist at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nigrand Hospital And Medical Center</PHI> and with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">N Tland</PHI> at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">DH</PHI> .
She will have scheduled appointment made through the vascular access program for access revision .

PRINCIPLE DIAGNOSIS :
LEFT ROTATOR CUFF TEAR .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 52-year-old right handed male with a many year history of bilateral shoulder pain , right greater than left .
He has steroid injections in the right and in the left four times .
Arthrogram in the distant past showed a right rotator cuff tear and he now has increased pain in his left shoulder .
MRI by report showed bilateral rotator cuff repairs and he was admitted for repair of the left rotator cuff .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Back pain .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
Ankle surgery times two on the right .
Pilonidal cyst removal .
MEDICATIONS :
On admission included Naprosyn .
ALLERGIES :
NO KNOWN DRUG ALLERGIES .
HABITS :
The patient smokes two packs per day and has an approximately a 75-pack-year history of smoking .
He has a history of drinking which he discontinued in <PHI TYPE="DATE">May</PHI> .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On admission revealed a white male with no palpable adenopathy .
HEENT exam was within normal limits .
Lungs revealed occasional wheezing bilaterally at both bases .
Heart was regular with a I / VI systolic ejection murmur without jugular venous distention .
Pulses were 2+ bilaterally .
Abdomen was obese with positive bowel sounds , nontender , nondistended .
Examination of his shoulder revealed the patient to be able to flex his right arm to 170 degrees , internally rotate to 10 degrees and externally rotate to 40 degrees with positive joint tenderness .
All range of motion with his right shoulder was painful .
The left shoulder was identical in range of motion and was also painful .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted with the assessment of left rotator cuff repair and he was taken to the Operating Room on the day of admission where he underwent left rotator cuff repair under general endotracheal tube anesthesia .
There were no intraoperative complications .
His postoperative course was generally unremarkable except for a prolonged course of advancement with range of motion of his left shoulder .
Occupational therapy became involved initially and he remained on patient controlled analgesia secondary to problems with left shoulder pain .
He was kept in the hospital for an extended period to improve his postoperative range of motion .
However , he was eventually able to achieve forward flexion of 135 degrees and external rotation of 30 degrees by postoperative day number eight .
His wound remained clean and dry and showed no signs of infection and healed well .
However , his course was otherwise complicated by discovery of persistently elevated blood sugars and Endocrinology was consulted to rule out possible newly diagnosed diabetes .
His hemoglobin A1C levels actually came back within normal limits , however , the wide excursions of his sugars were consistent with possible diabetes .
He was placed on a diabetic diet and his sugars did show some improvement .
It was not necessary to start him on oral hypoglycemics or insulin .
He also complained of occasional spells and jitteriness and some orthostatic dizziness and thus Neurology was consulted and EMG &apos;s were performed which were normal .
His neurologist was contacted , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Cap</PHI> , and the exact of his problems was not demonstrated during this hospitalization , however , they felt that this could possibly be an autonomic type neuropathy maybe secondary to some underlying diabetic process .
Further work-up of his neurologic conditions were planned as an outpatient .
Thus , he was discharged on postoperative day number eight in good condition with a well healed left shoulder wound and doing well with occupational therapy with plans for him to follow-up with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Necessary</PHI> .

1.) CV .
(I). Trop 0.15 , and TWI anterolateral , but likely has some demand w biventricular enlargement w chronic HTN and possible pulm HTN .
Also may have vasospasm w crack use .
Got lovenox 80 in ED , but likely doesn &apos;t need anti-platelet meds as yet .
-- Trop still 0.17 on 3rd draw , likely will take a long time to come down , still no indication for anti-platelet agents
-- ASA 81 , no B blocker because of recent crack use , fasting lipids <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/21</PHI>/06 actually looked very good with LDL 91 .
ECHO <PHI TYPE="DATE">2/22</PHI> shows enlarged LV with EF roughly 25% , biatrial enlargement and moderate mitral regurgitation .
Started bumex ( patient preferred this to lasix because her father had lasix in the past and did poorly ) and lisinopril as an outpatient .
She was assigned to a new cardiologist Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Pulefreierm</PHI> whom she will see one week after discharge .
-- BP control with captopril , converted to lisinopril for discharge . (R) .
NSR , no active issues .
2.) PULM .
CXR slightly improved , afebrile , normal WBC , but had terrible exam on admission .
No antibiotics were given and sputum culture grew oral flora .

BRIEF RESUME OF HOSPITAL COURSE :
CC :
Atypical CP 54 yo smoker , hx of hyperlipidemia , htn , DM , TAH / BSO age 48 , and hx of atypical cp .
She presented in 1999 and stress-ECHO , she exercised 9.5 min without pain , ECHO was nl with no wall motional abn , but EKG showed 1mm ST depressions .
In 2001 , she again p / w CP and ETT again showed 1mm ST depression , exercised 9min .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/23</PHI>/03 , pt p / w worsening R leg &quot; heat &quot; x 2 days , no difficulty ambulating , min pain .
While waiting for LENI &apos;s in ED , she developed CP , similar to old pain , in low sub-sternal area radiating to left shoulder , no EKG changes .
An ETT was done--pt exercised 9.5 min and there was 2mm ST depression inferiorly and laterally where persisted for 10 minutes during rest .
Enzymes flat .
*** Initial Plan *** ***
CV isch :
Pt has sig risk factors for CAD .
But given no symptoms during exercise x 9.5 min and neg enzymes after exercise , CP is likely not CAD .
However , she is still at high risk for CAD .
Will plan for Cath on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/24</PHI> .
Cont ASA , Lopressor , Zocor .
*** Vasc :
LENI &apos;s to rule out DVT of R leg
*** Endo :
CZI sliding scale .
*** Hosp course ***
Enzymes were flat x3 and pt was ruled out for MI .
A cardiac catheterization was performed which showed clean coronary arteries .
Therefore , she pain was not cardiac .
It is important to note in the future that she physiologically develops 1-2 mm ST depressions during ETT and she reports no pain during ETT .
She should have Stress MIBI or Stress ECHO if there is suspicion of CAD in to future .
Lower extremitiy non-invasives were performed for the R leg &quot; heat &quot; which were negative .
She is discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/25</PHI> .

Chest x-ray revealed a small right lower lobe infiltrate , on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">14th</PHI> , with a tiny effusion on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">20th</PHI> , the night of admission .
The pneumonia was now noted to be much larger , with a new right middle lobe infiltrate , as well as with a diffuse reticular interstitial pattern noted at the fringes of the pneumonic infiltrate .
Sputums were sent off for gram stain and culture , as well as for AFB smear cultures .
His electrocardiogram was within normal limits .
His urine sediment was basically within normal limits .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cliffestreukote</PHI> was admitted on the night of the <PHI TYPE="DATE">20th</PHI> , for obvious right lung pneumonia .
The differential diagnosis included several organisms as outlined below .
(1) Pneumonia .
He was admitted for a pneumonia unresponsive to antibiotics for five days .
The pneumonia was found to be multilobar , and accompanied by significant hypoxia .
He was started on broad spectrum coverage , including ceftriaxone , Clindamycin , and Ciprofloxacin .
The ration off for the utilization of the Ciprofloxacin , was that because of his allergy to Erythromycin , an alternative regimen was needed to cover for Legionella , which was probably the leading diagnosis at the time of admission , because of his hyponatremia accompanied by liver function abnormalities .
However , he was isolated , and three AFB smears were obtained , in order to rule out tuberculosis .
In addition , sputum induction was performed for Pneumocystis , which was negative .
His urinary Legionella antigen subsequently came back negative .
However , this test is only 85-95% sensitive for Legionella pneumophila , type I , which is the subtype that causes some 80% of legionnaires disease .
However , the Legionella antigen is neither sensitive , nor specific , for other Legionella species that may be involved in Legionella pneumonia .
Therefore , the Ciprofloxacin was continued .
In addition , his sputum cultures were all negative , as of the day of admission .
After admission , with the initiation of antibiotic therapy , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cliffestreukote</PHI> remained quite hypoxic .
However , within one to two days after admission , he defervesced with a significant decrease in his cough during the week , post admission .
Because of persistent hypoxemia on room air , as well as nasal cannula , some concern was raised about the possibility of underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease , versus some other lesion that may predispose him for persistent hypoxemia , ( i.e. malignancy ) .
Therefore , an evaluation by the Pulmonary Team of the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tonwe Hospital</PHI> , as well as a sputum cytology and chest CT scan , were all obtained .
The chest CT scan revealed evidence for emphysematous changes of his lungs , as well as the previously noted right pneumonia , with several pseudo abscesses noted in infected bullae .
His sputum cytology is pending at the time of discharge .
The Pulmonary Team felt that the patient exhibited significant physical findings , laboratory values , and radiologic features , all consistent with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
Therefore , his persistent hypoxemia may be secondary to that underlying disease .
Despite being afebrile , with significant decrease in his cough , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cliffestreukote</PHI> will be maintained , after discharge , on eleven more days of antibiotic therapy , to complete a full course .
It should be noted , that Clindamycin was discontinued , approximately three days after admission , because of the development of diarrhea .
Additionally , when switched to oral medication , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cliffestreukote</PHI> was switched to Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. , as well as continuing on his Ciprofloxacin 150 mg. p.o. b.i.d.
(2) Hypertension .
While in the hospital , Mr. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Cliffestreukote</PHI> was maintained on hydrochlorothiazide , and Verapamil SR , and required no additional medication .
(3) Hyponatremia .
While in the hospital , persistent type of natremia was noted on the patient &apos;s Profile 7 labs .
It was felt that this was due largely to his pulmonary disease , and would resolve with the resolution of his intrapneumonic process .
While in the hospital , there were no complications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
Augmentin 500 mg. p.o. t.i.d. for eleven more days , Ciprofloxacin 750 mg. p.o. b.i.d. for eleven days , hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. p.o. q. day , Verapamil SR 240 mg. p.o. q. day , and Atrovent meter dose inhaler two puffs four times a day .
DISPOSITION :
His condition on discharge was stable .
He was discharged to home .
He has a followup appointment with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Naaan Jesc</PHI> , in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Tonwe Hospital</PHI> Pulmonary Clinic on <PHI TYPE="DATE">2-18</PHI>-95 , at 9:45 A.M. , as well as with his primary care physician , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rybam Selcjescpint</PHI> .
His estimated disability is mild .
We are still awaiting the results of his HIV testing .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Orthostatic hypotension .
OTHER PROBLEMS :
Hyponatremia .
Hypokalemia .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 66 year old white female without a significant past medical history who presented in the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Middso Memorial Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room following a nine day history of dizziness on standing without loss of consciousness .
During the week prior to admission , the patient complained of severe constipation , dry mouth , possible urinary retention along with some nausea and vomiting .
She felt that she was profoundly cold at the time .
In the emergency room , the patient was hypotensive with an initial blood pressure of 92/70 and a pulse of 96 lying flat that became 70/50 with a pulse of 104 when standing .
The patient was aggressively hydrated with a total of 9 liters of normal saline over a 7 hour period with marginal increase in blood pressure .
Over the same period of time , the patient became increasingly hypoxic and developed worsening hypertension .
Stat chest x-ray showed pulmonary edema .
The patient was subsequently transferred to the MICU on Dopamine for further management .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Only noticeable for remote appendectomy and being gravida V , para V .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
None .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient has an 80-pack-year history of tobacco and is currently smoking 1-2 packs per day .
She also has a questionable alcohol history of up to one quart daily .
She is married and lives with her husband .
FAMILY HISTORY :
Notable for coronary artery disease in both parents without a history of cancer or autoimmune disease , diabetes , thyroid disease .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was an agitated elderly white female .
Temperature 97.8 , blood pressure 112/58 on Dopamine , pulse 134 , respirations 28 , oxygen saturation 93% on 100% nonrebreather .
HEENT :
Showed pupils equal , round and reactive to light .
Extraocular muscles intact .
Oropharynx benign .
Eyebrows were notable for lateral thinning .
Neck was supple without lymphadenopathy .
Carotids were 2+ .
No palpable thyroid .
Lungs showed decreased breath sounds bilaterally .
Cardiac exam revealed S1 , S2 with an intermittent S4 without murmur or rubs .
Abdominal exam was benign .
Extremities showed mild clubbing , no cyanosis and no edema .
Neurologic exam :
The patient was alert , agitated and oriented to name , date and place moving all extremities .
Light touch was intact .
ADMISSION LABS :
Sodium 127 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 76 , bicarb 35 , BUN 13 , creatinine 0.9 , glucose 105 , serum osmolality 254 , hematocrit 43.5 , white count 10.0 with 68% polys , 20% lymphs and 10 monos .
Platelets 310 .
PT and PTT were normal .
LFT &apos;s were within normal limits .
Admission cortisol , aldosterone , B12 and folate and TSH were drawn .
Chest x-ray on transfer to the MICU showed pulmonary vascular redistribution without infiltrate , effusions or nodules as compared with an admission chest x-ray which was interpreted as clear .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
In the MICU , the patient initially required Dopamine for five days , at which point , she tolerated a wean without recurrent light headedness , dizziness or syncope .
Echocardiogram revealed preserved ejection fraction without regional wall motion abnormalities .
The patient had a Swan-Ganz catheter placed which showed a cardiac output of 8 with systemic vascular resistance of 700 .
Because the Swan-Ganz readings were felt to be explained by sepsis , the patient was treated empirically with Cefotaxime , Gentamicin and Flagyl .
All cultures were subsequently negative with the exception of an E coli UTI .
The infectious workup included a lumbar puncture which was negative for pleocytosis but showed an elevated glucose of 106 and an elevated protein of 76 .
The patient had an extensive workup for hypopituitarism .
Because Addisonian crisis could not be initially ruled out , the patient was placed on distressed dose Cortisone .
However , a random cortisol level drawn initially in the emergency room subsequently returned as normal .
The patient also responded appropriately to Cortrosyn stimulation test .
Also , TSH was normal on admission .
Thyroid function panel drawn while the patient was on Dopamine was subsequently abnormal .
However , repeat panel was drawn when the patient was stable and had been transferred to the floor and was pending at the time of discharge .
The patient was also evaluated by the neurology service for possible dysautonomia as the cause of her orthostatic hypotension with an inappropriate heart rate response to hypotension .
EMG showed no evidence of peripheral neuropathy .
Additional studies also included a head CT that showed a small Lacunar infarct in the right pons and a partial empty sella which was confirmed by head MRI .
Other studies sent during the workup included a negative serum and urine protein electrophoresis , negative serum and urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis .
LH and SSH levels were consistent with a post-menopausal state .
Galactin levels were within normal limits .
ANA was negative .
Ace level was negative .
Heavy metal screen was negative except for a slightly elevated cobalt level so a possibility of a perineoplastic syndrome was considered .
An anti-YO RI and WHO antibodies were sent and were pending at the time of discharge .
On hospital day eight , the patient had uneventfully weaned off Dopamine and was transferred to the floor .
At that time , the stress dose Hydrocortisone was weaned and the patient was switched to Prednisone without any evidence of recurrent hypotension .
Her initial hyponatremia and hypokalemia resolved with stable sodium and potassium levels prior to discharge .
In the studying of aggressive fluid resuscitation , it was felt that the patient had been sent into pulmonary edema .
The patient auto-diuresed spontaneously .
Subsequent to the diuresis , reticulonodular diffuse pattern became apparent on chest x-ray .
Because of the patient &apos;s significant smoking history , chest PT was performed to evaluate the possibility of lymphangitic carcinomatosis .
However , the chest CT showed relative sparing of the lower lobes with primary involvement in both upper lobes .
The patient following diuresis had no oxygen requirement whatsoever and had no respiratory complaints .
Prior to discharge , she was evaluated by the pulmonary service who felt that the differential diagnosis for her chest CT included eosinophilic granuloma , idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis , less likely sarcoidosis .
Because the patient had no respiratory symptoms , it was felt that her abnormal chest CT would be best evaluated as an out-patient .
A new baseline chest x-ray was obtained prior to discharge .
She will also require baseline pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Prednisone taper 40 mg p.o. q day times two days , 30 mg p.o. q day times two days , 20 mg p.o. q day times three days , 10 mg p.o. q day times three days , 5 mg p.o. q day times three days .
Multi-vitamin one p.o. q day .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
Stable .
DISPOSITION :
The patient will be discharged to home .
She will follow-up with <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Jacrendonate Sella</PHI> , M.D. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/6</PHI>/95 .
She will need a pulmonary referral and pulmonary function tests as an out-patient .
At the time of discharge , studies that were pending included a repeat thyroid function panel , aldosterone levels and anti-WHO and anti-YO and RI antibodies .

He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .
His first coronary bypass surgery was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/7</PHI>/1985 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riez</PHI> .
He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .
He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .
He had normal left ventricular function .
He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in <PHI TYPE="DATE">March</PHI> of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .
The left main was normal .
The LAD was also occluded .
The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .
The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .
The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .
For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/5</PHI>/2000 by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Riez</PHI> .
He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .
He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .
The LIMA was left from the first surgery .
He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .
He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/28</PHI>/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .
He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/17</PHI>/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .
He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .
He also has had cataract repairs .
FAMILY HISTORY :
He has a strong family history with a father and an uncle having had coronary disease at a young age .

His social history is that he lives in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Lotyvall 1 , Quera , Minnesota</PHI> with his wife <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Second</PHI> .
He has four children .
He is present in a <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Capefrecam Luhthousy</PHI> .

His blood pressure is 130/75 .
His pulse is 50 and regular .
His neck veins are not distended .
His head and neck exam is normal .
His lungs are clear .
His cardiac exam shows no murmurs or gallops .
His abdomen is benign .
His peripheral pulses are intact .
His neurologic exam was nonfocal .
He is fully oriented .
LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :
Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .
Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .
There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .
The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .
The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .
The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .
This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .
It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .
Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .
He tolerated the procedure well .
He was monitored for the day .
He ambulated without difficulty .
He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health</PHI> and at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Middso Memorial Hospital</PHI> &apos;s .

HOSPITALIZATION COURSE :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">July 27</PHI> , 2006 , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Straight</PHI> underwent pelviscopy that was converted to a laparotomy with right salpingo-oophorectomy , lysis of adhesions , right ileal resection with primary reanastomosis and appendectomy .
Please refer to operative report dictation for full details of the operative course .
Briefly , there is noted to be dense adhesions involving the ileum , the appendix , cecum , pelvic cystic mass and the right ovary .
In the course of lysis of adhesions a small enterotomy in ileum was noted .
General surgical consultation was obtained from Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Obe</PHI> who performed lysis of ileal adhesions with another small enterotomy secondary to dense adhesions .
An approximately 3-4 cm segment of the ileum was resected with a primary end to end reanastomosis .
The estimated blood loss was 200 ml .
The final surgical pathology showed a right hemorrhagic cyst of undetermined origin with extensive adhesions , peri-appendiceal adhesions and ileum with adhesions .
Postoperatively , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Straight</PHI> was maintained with an NG tube and bowel rest until postoperative day #5 when she passed flatus .
Of note , on postoperative day #3 and #4 , she spiked isolated temperatures to 101 .
Evaluation was unrevealing in terms of focal source of her fever .
The urine and blood cultures were negative .
Chest x-ray was negative .
After postoperative day #4 , she experienced no further episodes of fever .
Following her NG tube discontinuation on postoperative day #5 , she experienced three to four episodes of bilious emesis .
On examination , her abdomen was nondistended and she had normal bowel sounds .
A KUB confirmed no evidence of an ileus or obstruction .
She was managed conservatively and kept npo for one night and then her diet was advanced slowly .
By the evening of postoperative day #7 , she was tolerating full house diet and had two spontaneous bowel movements .
It was unclear her etiology of her emesis following NG tube removal although possibly secondary to a subclinical ileus .
It is also a possibility that she had gastroenteritis from her relative who had presented recently to the ED with similar course of low grade fevers , emesis that resolved in short course .
At time of discharge ( postoperative day #8 <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/04</PHI>/06 ) , she was tolerating a house diet .

SERVICE :
GMS 1 Medical Service .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
GI bleed .
DISCHARGE CONDITION :
Stable .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Patient &apos;s hospital course is as follows :
Patient is an 84-year-old male who was transferred from an outside hospital with a low hematocrit of 21 and with guaiac-positive stool .
The day prior to admission , he experienced dyspnea on exertion , and on the day of admission he collapsed and complained of substantial weakness .
He denied any melana , any hematemesis , nausea or vomiting .
He was taken to an outside hospital at the time at which time it was found that his hematocrit was 21 , blood pressure 90/60 , and his INR was 3.3 .
Of note , he is anti-coagulated for an artificial heart valve .
He was at that point given 1 unit of packed red blood cells .
On further questioning , the patient reported that he started to feel &quot; different &quot; several days ago with slowing and difficult ambulation progressing to complete inability to ambulate .
He was also short of breath with ambulation , but he does have baseline shortness of breath with exertion .
He denied any chest pain , dysuria , loss of consciousness , fevers , chills or any history of myocardial infarction .
Patient was last admitted to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Padrugmoff Hospital</PHI> with a hematocrit of 24.5 , and was asymptomatic prior to admission .
At that time , he had guaiac-positive and had a small bowel follow through which was negative .
He was transfused 4 units during that admission and discharged with a hematocrit of 34 on vitamin C and iron sulfate .
EXAM ON ARRIVAL IN THE <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">LO HOSPITAL</PHI> EMERGENCY ROOM :
On arrival at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lo Hospital</PHI> Emergency Room :
He was found to have a temperature of 97.4 , heart rate 65 , pressure 107/52 , respiratory rate 22 and saturating 100% on 2 L of a nasal cannula .
General exam at the time was notable for pale mucous membranes , left lateral eye deviation , clear lungs , 2/6 holosystolic murmur , best heard at the apex , abdomen was mildly distended but was soft and nontender and his extremities were without edema and skin without any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is as follows :
History of coronary artery disease with status post two-vessel CABG in 1986 , also he was treated for congestive heart failure , hypertension , aortic valve replacement , and mitral valve replacement with St. Jude &apos;s valve in <PHI TYPE="DATE">09</PHI>/2001 , atrial fibrillation , history of prior GI bleed requiring blood transfusions during which he also had a colonoscopy on <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/2003 which demonstrated no neoplasia and scattered diverticuli .
The patient also , following his first GI bleed , had an EEG done in <PHI TYPE="DATE">07</PHI>/2003 which showed gastritis with oozing and evidence of a recent bleed .
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
MEDICATIONS :
Included Lasix , Lopressor , Coumadin , Diovan , torsemide , Flomax , Protonix , Senekot , potassium , vitamin C , iron , and a multivitamin .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
Notable for no tobacco , no alcohol .
He has a wife with Alzheimer &apos;s who lives in a skilled-nursing facility .
LABORATORY DATA :
Notable for a BUN and creatinine of 78 , 1.7 ; for a sodium , potassium 139 and 3.6 ; chloride and bicarb 108 , 21 .
White count 7 , hematocrit 24.2 , platelet count was 183 .
His INR was also 3.4 .
PTT was 55 .
His EKG was notable for right bundle branch block , left axis deviation , but was in sinus rhythm .
His UA had 10-17 white blood cells ; trace leukocyte esterase hyaline casts numbering 60-70 .
His chest x-ray was notable for clear lungs with no edema or infiltrates and small bilateral effusions .
OTHER NOTALBE LABS :
Patient was found to have a troponin of 0.71 on admission with a CK of 46 and CKMB of 3.4 .
ASSESSMENT :
At that time , it was felt that the patient was likely having a repeat GI bleed and while he was hemodynamically stable , he had evidently lost a substantial amount of blood .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
1. GI :
Patient was transfused 2 units of packed red blood cells overnight , the first night after admission and his hematocrit bumped up appropriately .
He remained hemodynamically stable throughout his admission .
He was continued on a proton pump inhibitor and on iron sulfate and vitamin C .
His Coumadin was held at the time given the bleeding , even though it was important to keep his INR 2.5-3.5 , given his artificial valve it was felt that the risk of continued bleeding was to great to continue the Coumadin .
He was subsequently seen by the GI team who performed an upper endoscopy which demonstrated the following :
In the esophagus , there was a small hiatal hernia and in the stomach there is evidence of erosive gastritis of the body of the stomach and the antrum , the mucous appeared edematous .
A small polyp was found in the fundus which stigmata of old bleeding ; an Endoclip was applied to this .
Another polyp was found in the antrum and cold biopsies were obtained there .
In the duodenum , a small AVM was noted in the second portion of the duodenum and was cauterized .
The biopsy subsequently demonstrated a hyperplastic polyp with acute and chronic inflammation and erosion and reactive epithelial changes but no dysplasia .
Also of note , prior to the upper endoscopy , the patient received fresh frozen plasma to reverse his anticoagulation .
Patient remained hemodynamically stable during and after the upper endoscopy and his hematocrit remained above 30 following this until the point of discharge .
His last recorded hematocrit on discharge was 31.3 .
His last BUN and creatinine were 42 and 1.5 with an INR of 2.5 .
Consideration was given to performing a repeat colonoscopy .
This was discussed with the GI Service who felt that this was not necessary given the recent colonoscopy that he had had in <PHI TYPE="DATE">05</PHI>/2003 .
2. Cardiovascular :
A :
Ischemia :
Patient &apos;s troponin bump was found to be likely to demand ischemia in the setting of his GI bleed , it was not felt that he was having acute coronary syndrome .
On discharge , he was continued on his aspirin , simvastatin and his Lopressor which was initially held , and subsequently restarted .
B :
Rhythm :
Patient continued to be in A-fib. throughout the admission and was restarted on his Coumadin concurrently with heparin .
Heparin was subsequently DCd once his INR reached a therapeutic level between 2.5-3.5 .
His last reported INR on discharge was 2.5 .
C :
Valves :
Patient had , as noted above , his anticoagulation was initially reversed despite his having artificial valves .
However , his Coumadin was subsequently restarted and he achieved therapeutic INR levels before discharge .
D :
Pump :
Patient , during this hospital course , became hypervolemic likely due to his diuretics being held and due to his receiving blood products .
He was diuresed initially with one dose of Lasix and subsequently with one dose of torsemide after it was discovered that he developed thrombocytopenia on a prior admission in reaction to Lasix .
He subsequently was diuresed to a euvolemic state .
Of note , he did not become thrombocytopenic on this admission .
DISPOSITION :
Was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/2003 in stable condition with the last recorded hematocrit of 31.3 .
He was asked to continue on his Nexium , iron and vitamin C and was continued on his other home medications .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
His final medications on discharge were as follows :
Aspirin 325 , he was restarted on a PPI , also on iron , vitamin C , Lopressor 12.5 b.i.d .
Of note , this was at a decreased dose compared to that which he came in on , Coumadin 7.5 , mg , torsemide 100 q.d. , sucralfate , simvastatin , Diovan .
CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :
He was discharged in stable condition with instructions to follow up with his PCP as well as to follow up with the Anticoagulation Clinic and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gilbert</PHI> .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 55-year-old female with a history of poorly controlled diabetes , status post multiple admissions for HHNK , and recent right arm fracture .
Patient initially presented four days ago to the emergency room .
At that time , she was febrile , with no obvious source of infection .
She was sent home with pain control .
Cultures were pending .
Over the past days before admission , the patient had been complaining of increased arm pain .
Of note , the patient states that her pain is so bad that she was not taking her insulin .
On the morning of admission , the son could not reach her by phone .
He was concerned .
<PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">LRAH</PHI> then called to say that they found her in the house very confused , called EMS , and she was brought into the hospital .
Per the son , patient not complaining of any other problems ; no chest pain , no shortness of breath , no upper respiratory symptoms , no cough , no dysuria , and no abdominal pain .
Of note , blood cultures from <PHI TYPE="DATE">Christmas Eve</PHI> grew MSSA in the blood .
In the emergency room , she was given 6 units subcu , with no resolve , then insulin drip at 6 units per hour , then increased to 10 including with IV hydration , and she was started on nafcillin for MSSA .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Cirrhosis , hep C , diabetes , rheumatoid arthritis , hypertension , neuropathy , right arm fracture , status post fall , CAD , with a stress echo <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/1</PHI> which showed reversible ischemia and an EF of 60% .
Her medications on admission included Lasix 80 , Norvasc 2.5 , Lopressor 50 b.i.d. , lisinopril 40 q. day , Risperdal one q. day , Humulin 70/30 40 U in the morning and 25 U in the evening , regular insulin scale , carbamazepine 100 , and Neurontin .
She has no known drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
The patient lives alone .
She walks with a cane , has <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">LRAH</PHI> care , no tobacco , no alcohol , no drug use .
PHYSICAL EXAM ON ADMISSION :
She was afebrile at 97.6 , heart rate 102 , respirations 20 , blood pressure 192/92 .
In general , she was an obese African American woman in no acute distress , mumbling .
HEENT :
Pupils equal and reactive , her oropharynx was moist with no lesions .
Cardiovascularly , she was tachycardic , normal S1 and S2 , regular , no murmurs .
JVP was flat .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation .
Abdomen was obese , soft , non-tender , no masses , no rebound , and no guarding .
EXTREMITIES :
She had swelling in the right arm , very , very minimal .
Her right arm was on a sling .
In her lower extremities , she had bilateral edema to the knees , 2+.
NEURO :
She was oriented to person only , intermittently following commands .
Labs were notable for blood cultures positive for MSSA .
Chest x-ray was pending at the time of admission .
Head CT was negative .
EKG showed normal sinus , no ST changes .
Her labs were notable on admission for a sodium of 129 , creatinine of 2.0 , hematocrit of 34 , albumin was 2.5 .
She had a gap of 14 .
Her ABG was 7.40 , 47 , 90 .
Her CKs and troponins were negative .
Her beta hydroxybutyrate was 0.36 .
Her UA showed 3+ protein , 5-8 WBCs , 8-10 RBCs , and 1+ bacteria .
HOSPITAL COURSE BY SYSTEM :
This is a 55-year-old with a history of uncontrolled diabetes in the past , who presents with HHNK .
At the time , she was treated for such , including IV fluids and an insulin drip .
She recovered very nicely .
Continued hospital course , she recovered well from her HHNK .
Ortho-wise , emergent ortho consult decided that the right shoulder needed to be drained .
Tap showed that she had an active infection , with 464000 WBCs , 198000 RBCs , including 88% polys , from the right shoulder .
Therefore , she was thought to have right shoulder sepsis and was taken to the OR emergently .
In the operating room , 40-50 cc of pus was drained from the shoulder and a drain was placed .
She received IV fluids and had an estimated blood loss of 1200 cc .
The patient &apos;s crit dropped from a baseline of 32 to 19 .
She was also not following commands and her glucose was 876 .
She was then transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit .
In the Medical Intensive Care Unit on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/30</PHI>/02 , the patient was recovering , with being able to follow commands .
She stayed in the Intensive Care Unit until <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI>/03 .
She was treated with nafcillin and gentamicin , also with vancomycin .
Cultures still showed MSSA .
Hospital course during the MICU stay was notable for a decreased hematocrit .
She received multiple units of blood for this .
Also , she had decreased urine output , thought to be prerenal , and received large volume IV fluids .
She required small doses , a renal dose of dopa , to increase her urine output , and she did better .
She responded well and then the dopa was D / c&apos;d on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4</PHI>/03 .
From the ID perspective , the patient had a TTE on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/30</PHI> that showed an EF of 65% , question of a mobile echodensity along the RV , but no proof of endocarditis .
This was significant in that the head CT done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/4</PHI>/03 to evaluate change in mental status revealed a new right parietal infarct that may represent septic emboli ; however , on further evaluation it was thought that this was most likely a stroke , not really just sepsis .
There was no recommendation for further workup .
She was transferred to the floor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">1/5</PHI>/03 , and by system :
1. ID :
She was continued to be treated for MSSA bacteremia and she should complete a 6 weeks course .
2. RENAL :
Patient slowly improved with her creatinine on the day of admission , still continuing to improve .
Secondary to all the IV fluids she received in the Intensive Care Unit , the patient has been having a goal of -1 L / day , which we have been able to accomplish successfully on Lasix 120 mg p.o. b.i.d. , with extra doses of 80 mg IV as needed .
3. Cardiovascularly , patient , of note , had an EKG that had intermittent right bundle-branch block ; however , this recovered .
She does have known CAD from previous echos .
She has been stable .
She is on a beta blocker .
Her ACE inhibitor had been held , but may be restarted as soon as her creatinine normalizes .
4. NEUROLOGICAL :
Her head CT showed a right parietal infarct .
Patient should have an MRI as an outpatient to follow up .
Most likely represents an ischemic stroke .
Workup for B12 and RPR studies were all negative .
5. GI-wise , the patient had been started on tube feeds ; however , she recovered and NG tube was D / c&apos;d and patient taking p.o.&apos;s .
She was also started on lactulose to increase her bowel movements as needed .
Her ammonia level is normalized .
6. Heme-wise , her hematocrit remained stable .
7. Endocrine-wise , her sugars have been much improved and she continues on her NPH dose .
Plan for the long term is that the patient will receive six weeks of IV antibiotics .
She will return to see Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Ayan Koteskismanhout</PHI> in orthopaedic surgery in 10-12 weeks for evaluation of the right shoulder and aspiration .
If the aspirate is negative and overall health is good , then she will consider implantation of hemiarthroscopy ; for now , she needs to continue in the sling .
For access , the patient will have a PICC line in order to continue IV fluids .
The discharge medications include albuterol nebulizer 2.5 q. 2 h. as needed , calcium carbonate 1250 b.i.d. , carbamazepine 100 p.o. t.i.d. , Lasix 120 p.o. q. day , insulin sliding scale , lactulose 15-30 mL p.o. q.i.d. as needed .

IMPRESSION AND PLAN :
This is a 63-year-old lady with stage IV colon cancer , status post three chemo regimens , then she was on a phase one trial .
She presented with increasing LFTs and renal failure .
1. Hypertension , infectious disease .
The patient was hypertensive to 60s through much of her stay .
She had E. coli in her urine and she was placed on Levaquin .
Differential diagnosis included urosepsis and intravascular sleep depletion .
Because of her rising LFTs and renal failure , she was thought to be in hepatorenal , see below .
We continued to administer serum-poor albumin throughout the day even until her death .
2. Renal failure .
The patient was in acute renal failure and had hypertension .
The differential diagnosis included hypertension , hypovolemia , and nephrotoxicity due to the drug , and tumor lysis leading to hepatorenal or hepatorenal in itself .
The patient had a renal ultrasound .
This showed mild left hydronephrosis , no real etiology for this .
Her creatinine is slowly climbed to greater than 4.6 upon her death .
She was in fluid restriction to 1.5 litres a day .
Renal failure was thought likely to be due to hypovolemia from hyperperfusion as well as hepatorenal syndrome .
We continued allopurinol .
3. Increasing LFTs and INR .
The patient had increasing LFTs and her T. bili climbed to greater than 9 upon death .
This is likely due to hepatorenal syndrome .
Also , the patient could have had the tumor metabolizing .
There was no evidence of obstruction .
4. The patient &apos;s increased LDH , uric acid , and BUN and creatinine are all consistent with tumor lysis .
This is likely thought to be due to an increased tumor burden and not necessarily from the medication .
It became clear throughout the patient &apos;s hospital course that she was becoming very sick and the patient accepted this .
With her wishes that her she was DNR / DNI , we eventually made her CMO , comfort measures only .
She was awake and entertaining friends and family through most of her hospital stay .
She often may talk openly about her death that was impending .
On the two days prior to her death , she was more unresponsive and on the day of her death , she was unconscious through most of the day .
The patient was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">04/16</PHI>/05 .
One of her sons and her nephew were present in the room .
The family decline autopsy and the chaplain visited .

She smoked two cigarettes per day x30 years , but quit in the 1960s .
She is a former museum curator .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
On exam , afebrile , pulse in the 60s , saturating in the upper 90s at rest on room air .
With exertion , she was noted to desaturate to the mid 70s .
There was no significant JVP elevation .
Breath sounds were diminished at the right base along with dullness to percussion at the right base .
Heart was regular rate and rhythm with a normal P2 .
There was no RV heave .
No murmur was appreciated .
Abdomen was mildly distended , but soft and nontender .
There was trace pretibial leg edema .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Walking</PHI> underwent thoracentesis by interventional radiology .
They removed 600 cc of yellow fluid .
Fluid characteristics were exudative .
Cytology and microbiology including AFP cultures are pending at this time .
After the thoracentesis , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Walking</PHI> &apos;s ambulatory room air saturation was 94% and she was feeling better .
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Walking</PHI> also underwent echocardiogram .
Her LV ejection fraction was 77% .
The estimated RV systolic pressure was 47 .
Because of a concern of a solid mass on the lesser curvature of her stomach noted by abdominal CAT scan , Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Walking</PHI> had a GI consultation .
The gastroenterologist performed an EGD and EUS .
The EGD showed a normal esophagus , a submucosal mass in the cardia and fundus of the stomach with central umbilication , nodularity in the prepyloric antrum , and a normal duodenum .
The EUS showed a normal common bile duct , normal pancreas and a 4-cm gastric wall solid mass , which was hypoechoic , heterogenetic and lobulated in appearance .
She had biopsies taken , which are pending at this time .
Of note , there was an extensive differential diagnosis for her unilateral effusion including malignancy , tuberculosis , drug-induced lupus and less likely pestis related .
The exudative nature of the effusion argues against congestive heart failure or hepatic hydrothorax .
Ms. <PHI TYPE="PATIENT">Walking</PHI> was stable at the time of discharge .
She was discharged home .

Chest x-ray was low lung volumes , no consolidation .
EKG showed sinus brady at 16 , normal axis , normal intervals , no STT wave abnormalities .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to Team Four for cardiac monitoring and ruling out for MI .
Hospital course by system :
1. Cardiovascular :
The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .
The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .
The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .
This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .
However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .
It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .
The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/17</PHI>/04 .
This responded to fluid bolus .
The patient was then transferred to Medicine Team D given her tenuous hemodynamic status .
The patient , several days later <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/23</PHI> , underwent another dobutamine stress test .
This stress test , although complicated by hypotension again , to the 60 &apos;s or 70 &apos;s was completed and there was some mild anterior septal thinning , but no evidence of ischemia and an EF from this test was 76% .
Clearly , the patient &apos;s hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .
2. Infectious Disease :
On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .
The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .
She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/17</PHI>/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .
She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .
Her urine legionella antigen was negative .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/22</PHI>/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .
She was started on vancomycin for this .
These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .
She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .
3. GI :
The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">11/16</PHI>/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .
GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .
Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .
The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .
Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .
4. Shortness of breath :
As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .
At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .
This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .
5. Derm :
Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .
She was started on some Miconazole Cream .
The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .
The rash appeared to be resolving by the time of discharge .
MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :
Tums , 500-1250 mg PO tid .
Albuterol inhaler .
Lipitor , 20 daily .
Prozac , 60 daily .
Flovent inhaler , 220 mcg bid .
Atrovent , two puffs qid .

<PHI TYPE="DATE">03/28</PHI>/97
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Gait disorder .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31-year-old right-handed female with right-sided greater than left-sided weakness and difficulty walking for several days .
She was in her usual state of health until <PHI TYPE="DATE">3/20</PHI>/97 when she experienced the fairly sudden onset of predominantly right-sided arm and leg weakness and ataxia .
She was standing and walking with her friend , who &quot; had to catch her from falling down &quot; as she toppled towards the right .
She evidently recovered from the episode after a number of minutes .
The following day , she remained in bed through essentially all of the day due to malaise with no specific deficits being noted .
In the subsequent two days , she had several small spells of &quot; imbalance &quot; , particularly towards the right , and other symptoms included diffuse and mainly frontal headaches and mild neck soreness .
There was no diplopia , visual loss , speech abnormality or sensory change in her history .
She was initially evaluated at an outside hospital emergency room , and then transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Well General Hospital</PHI> .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Is notable for depression , and she has been followed regularly by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Freiermchird</PHI> of <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Nash Health</PHI> for several months with pharmacologic treatment , which is apparently working well .
Her Doxepin has recently been increased .
She is status post appendectomy and otherwise has no remarkable past medical history .
ALLERGIES :
Quinine gives her a rash .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
The only medications she is on are Paxil 30 mg p.o. q.day , Doxepin 25 mg p.o. q.day , and Klonopin 2 mg p.o. q.h.s.
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She is currently unemployed , but until recently , she was employed at a bank .
She was born and raised in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Atonlaremont Rockpo</PHI> .
There is a history of childhood abuse .
She does not drink .
She is a former tobacco user and takes no illicit drugs .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was pleasant , in no acute distress ; blood pressure 130/60 ; heart rate 66 ; respirations 18 ; temperature 98 .
Her thyroid was within normal limits .
There were no carotid or cervical bruits .
She had a normal S1 and S2 and regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs .
Her lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally .
Her abdomen was benign .
Her extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis , edema , or rash ; there were some older hematomas in the bilaterally shins .
Mental status - her speech was fluent without errors .
Her affect was slightly inappropriate at times ; for example , singing or humming along while performing some of the motor tasks and giving the impression of indifference to the deficits that were demonstrated on the examination .
Her memory was fully intact for short-term recollection of three out of three objects at five minutes with excellent naming , repetition , proverb interpretation , and ability to follow commands .
Visual fields were full to confrontation .
Her left pupil was 7 mm reacting to 5 mm .
Her right pupil was 5.5 mm reacting to 4 mm .
Her extraocular movements were intact for horizontal and vertical pursuits .
There was no nystagmus and no ptosis .
Her saccades were normal .
Facial strength and sensation were full and symmetric .
Her tongue , uvula and palate were midline .
Shoulder shrug was 5/5 power .
Motor examination revealed 5/5 power in all groups in the proximal and distal upper and lower extremities .
There was no drift .
There was normal bulk and tone .
She had slightly slow fine finger motility approximately equal bilaterally , although this was extremely difficult to reproduce .
Sensory - intact light touch , temperature , and vibration overall .
Reflexes were 2+ throughout in the upper and lower extremities , and toes were downgoing .
There was no jaw jerk and no Hoffman &apos;s sign .
Coordination - toe tap was slow bilaterally , although difficult to reproduce , and at best , was essentially within normal limits .
On standing , she tended to fall to the front , back or sides without trying to stop her fall initially , and extensive gait testing was deferred due to concerns for safety .
Her heel-to-shin and finger-to-nose testing was fully intact bilaterally without ataxia or tremor .
LABORATORY DATA :
Were unremarkable with normal electrolytes and complete blood count parameters .
Her erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 12 .
Her coagulation parameters were normal .
Head CT scan without contrast showed normal brain parenchyma and no intracranial process .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
The patient was admitted for her gait disorder with other notable findings on examination including anisocoria , which , by the patient &apos;s report , had been noted several months earlier .
A magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiogram study was obtained , which showed no clear evidence of arterial dissections or infarction or other pathologic processes .
She had been placed on heparin initially , but this was discontinued after the magnetic resonance imaging results were obtained .
Posterior transcranial Doppler studies showed normal studies of both vertebral arteries , and carotid non-invasive studies showed normal right and left carotid bifurcations .
On the second hospital day , her gait continued to be markedly unstable , although with no consistent pattern in terms of weakness or directionality of falling , and she continued to have no reproducible upper extremity or lower extremity ataxia or dysmetria .
She was seen by the Psychiatry Service .
She was not felt to be acutely suicidal or otherwise in need of acute psychiatric treatment .
The psychiatrist also noted the indifference the patient evinced regarding her own symptomatology .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSES :
1) EXTENSIVE POSTERIOR CIRCULATION INFARCTION .
2) ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is an 82 year-old right handed gentleman who has a past medical history of hypertension and tobacco use presented to the emergency room with acute change in mental status .
He was well until the evening prior to presentation to the emergency room when he complained of headache across the forehead .
On the day of presentation , he was then found by his daughter lying on his bed groaning , being relatively unresponsive and unable to speak .
The family reported one episode of vomiting at home .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient was afebrile , heart rate 73 , blood pressure 158/53 , respiratory rate 16-20 , oxygen saturation 97% on three liters .
General :
The patient was somnolent , breathing comfortably , occasionally coughing .
Neck was supple with full range of motion .
No bruits were heard .
Chest was clear to auscultation but with poor air entry .
Heart sounds were regular with one out of six holosystolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .
Abdomen was soft , non-tender , bowel sounds present .
Extremities were without clubbing , cyanosis or edema .
Neurological examination revealed a patient who was intermittently alert , opening eyes to voice , following simple commands , but without any speech .
Pupils were 4 mm reactive to 2 mm bilaterally .
There was no pupillary defect .
Dolls eye was negative .
There was a possible right gaze preference and the patient did not move his eyes .
Corneals were present bilaterally .
Gag was present weakly .
Face was symmetrical .
Tongue was midline .
The patient was moving the right side spontaneously , but could not hold arm or leg up for any length of time .
There was only minimal movement on the left side .
On sensory testing , the patient withdrew all extremities to pain .
Reflexes were 2+ and symmetrical all over .
The left toe was upgoing , the right toe was downgoing .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory data revealed a sodium of 139 , potassium 3.4 , chloride 101 , bicarbonate 28 , BUN 11 , creatinine 1.2 , glucose 151 .
AST was 20 , ALT 12 , alkaline phosphatase 80 , bilirubin 0.5. CK was 113 .
Thyroid function tests were normal .
Troponin I was 0.05 .
Total protein was 8 , albumin 4.3 , globulin 3.7 , calcium 9.9 , phosphate 2.7 , magnesium 2.0. White blood cell count was 7 , hemoglobin 14.1 , hematocrit 43.6 , platelet count 241 .
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 41 .
PT was 12.3 , PTT 27.1. An EKG showed sinus bradycardia at 53 with a normal axis , first degree atrioventricular block , biphasic T-waves in V1 to V3 without any acute changes .
A chest x-ray shows left lower lobe consolidation .
The head CT scan revealed a large right occipital infarct without midline shift , but positive mass effect on the temporal horn , on the right ventricle and some effacement of the sulci in the right parietal area .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to a telemetry bed and started on heparin .
Around 4:00 AM the next day , an acute decompensation in respiratory status was noted .
Lung examination at that point showed good air entry , no wheezing , coarse breath sounds throughout .
Neurologically , the patient was not following commands .
Eyes were closed .
He was moving the right arm and leg spontaneously , though less than before .
Withdrawal to pain was still present .
Both plantars were upgoing .
A blood gas at this point showed a pH of 7.49 , pO2 61 , pCO2 of 33 on 100% non-rebreather mask .
EKG showed sinus tachycardia .
The patient &apos;s temperature was 102 degrees .
A repeat CAT scan of the head was performed .
This showed continued evolution of the right posterior cerebral artery infarction now extending into the right cerebellar hemisphere .
There was also a high density adjacent to the right cerebellar infarction suggesting the presence of hemorrhage .
At this point , the patient was transferred to the intensive care unit .
An MRI and MRA of the head was arranged to evaluate the extent of his stroke and the posterior circulation .
The MRI showed infarct of the cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally , the right occipital lobe , the right thalamus and bilateral pons .
The MRA of the intracranial circulation demonstrated gross patency of the internal carotid arteries bilaterally and the basilar arteries .
The left vertebral artery was not visualized .
There was a dominant right vertebral artery .
There was mildly reduced flow in the branches of the right middle cerebral artery compared to the left .
There was visualization of flow within both posterior cerebral arteries .
Clinically , the patient continued to deteriorate .
Neurosurgery was consulted , however the neurosurgeons felt that there was no surgical option , since even in the case of cerebellar swelling , there would be no improvement from decompensation .
The patient was therefore treated conservatively with fluid restriction and blood pressure management .
Heparin was discontinued because of the risk of intercerebral hemorrhage .
The aspiration pneumonia was treated with Cefotaxime and Metronidazole .
The patient &apos;s family was involved and they decided to opt for DNR / DNI in view of the poor prognosis .
The patient passed away at 6:45 AM on <PHI TYPE="DATE">June 12</PHI> , 1998 .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
chest pain , ruled out for myocardial infarction .
ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :
asthma .
HISTORY :
52-year-old female , with a history of of nonsteroid dependent asthma , presenting with chest discomfort .
The patient stated that the previous week while in a pulmonary rehabilitation program , she underwent an exercise tolerance test .
During the procedure , she complained of a squeezing sensation in the chest , apparently associated with electrocardiographic abnormalities .
The day of admission , she noted the onset of the same chest pressure , radiating to the right shoulder , which she described as an &quot; awful feeling in her chest . &quot;
This lasted several hours and was relieved in the Emergency Department .
Mild nausea but not other cardiac related symptoms .
CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :
history of cigarette use , post menopausal , hypercholesterolemia .
In 1991 , she had an equivocal exercise tolerance test with a normal thallium study .
The patient also described a long history of &quot; cold weather &quot; exertion related chest discomfort that involved her &quot; sternum , back and insides , &quot; associated with asthma but not relieved by metered dose inhalers .
This symptoms she reports has been stable for years and was different than her presenting complaints .
On PHYSICAL EXAMINATION , 110/80 bilaterally , 68 , 18 .
Black female in no apparent distress .
Chest clear to auscultation .
Cardiovascular :
regular , without murmur , gallop or rub .
No increased jugular venous pressure .
Abdomen soft , nontender , no hepatosplenomegaly , no abdominal aortic aneurysm .
Extremities :
no clubbing , cyanosis or edema or G .
Rectal :
guaiac negative .
Electrocardiogram :
poor R-wave progression , no change versus <PHI TYPE="DATE">12</PHI>/93 .
Chest x-ray study :
low volumes , no active disease .
ADMISSION LABORATORY STUDIES :
complete blood count , electrolytes , creatinine normal .
This 52-year-old patient with a history of asthma , atypical chest pain , and recently positive exercise tolerance test was admitted to the medical service with a similar chest pain , which was not associated with electrocardiogram changes .
She ruled out for a myocardial infarction by creatine kinase enzymes .
Given the similarity of her current presentation to her recent positive stress test , and wish to avoid beta blockade , due to her asthma , an inpatient thallium study was ordered .
While in the hospital she remained pain free .
She exhibited no bronchospasm while taking enteric coated aspirin .
When an exercise thallium study was unable to be obtained 48 hours after admission , the patient was discharged to follow up for an out patient study and with her internist , Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Kanner</PHI> .
At discharge , she looked and felt well .

On post-operative day number two , the patient was started in a continuous passive motion device and by the time of discharge , was undergoing range of motion from 0 to 78 degrees with minimal discomfort .
She also began radiating non-weight bearing on her right lower extremity with the assistance of crutches with the help of Physical Therapy .
On the day prior to discharge , the patient was ambulating non-weight bearing on her right lower extremity and able to stair climb with crutches with the assistance of Physical Therapy .
On post-operative day number six , the patient reported some calf tenderness .
Lower extremity non-invasive studies were obtained which revealed no evidence of deep venous thrombosis .
Patient was undergoing Coumadin for deep venous thrombosis prophylaxis throughout her post-operative course .
Patient is discharged to home on post-operative day number eight ambulating non-weight bearing on the right lower extremities with the assistance of crutches , able to stair climb , and tolerating a regular diet with a minimal amount of pain of the right lower extremity .
She will continue to undergo Physical Therapy and CPM at home and she has a home CPM device arranged for her .

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
As mentioned in the problem list .
ALLERGIES :
The patient had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Vital signs :
Temperature 100.6 degrees , heart rate 102 , blood pressure 107/54 , oxygen saturation 92% on room air .
In general , he was an elderly white male sleeping flat in no acute distress , awakened easily , but was not oriented at all .
HEENT examination was benign .
Neck had no jugular venous distension and 2+ carotids bilaterally without bruits .
Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs appreciated .
Lungs had rhonchorous breath sounds bilaterally , scattered throughout , no egophony or clear area of consolidation was noted .
The abdomen was benign .
The extremities were without edema and had 2+ distal pulses .
Neurological examination was alert , but not oriented .
He followed some simple commands .
He moves all extremities well .
Gait was not tested .
LABORATORY :
Laboratory studies on admission included a sodium of 140 , potassium 2.6 , chloride 98 , bicarbonate 29 , BUN 22 , creatinine 1.1 , glucose 98 .
White blood cell count was 1.73 , hematocrit 37.0 , platelet count 215 .
Chest x-ray revealed a right middle lobe opacity , no effusion , no edema .
EKG was normal sinus rhythm with left axis deviation and right bundle branch block with prior inferior myocardial infarction .
There is no prior EKG available for comparison .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted and given a course of p.o. antibiotics including Levofloxacin and Flagyl with plans for a fourteen day course .
He initially received oxygen , two liters via nasal cannula , but had an oxygen saturation that remained at 92% on room air , so oxygen was discontinued .
His potassium was repleted from 2.6 up to 3.3 the day after admission and then up to 4.2 two days after admission .
The source for his hypokalemia was unknown .
He initially had watery diarrhea , thought secondary to soap ingestion which resolved two days after admission .
He was gently hydrated with 1/2 normal saline for two liters to keep up with his gastrointestinal losses .
He was continued on Risperdal which he takes for dementia .
He did have fevers the day after admission , but his fever curve gradually came down .
Because of the question of aspiration , a Speech and Swallow evaluation was obtained .
Before this evaluation , discussion was undertaken with the family who decided that even if the patient were aspirating that they would not want a feeding jejunal tube for feeding placed .
Speech evaluation felt that he may be aspirating occasionally when he coughs , however they did not recommend dietary modifications , but only that he be given soft , easily chewed items .
They also suggested that he be observed at meals to make sure that he paces himself to avoid aspirating .
They recommended follow-up evaluation if he develops further pneumonias or if he has increased coughing .
This can be arranged through his primary care physician or through the rehabilitation hospital if he is still an inpatient at rehabilitation .
The family also decided to make the patient DNR / DNI after he was admitted .
He will be transferred to rehabilitation to finish his course of antibiotics and to work on ambulation .
He will then return home with <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">HMC</PHI> services to live with his daughter-in-law and son .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
PERFORATED APPENDICITIS AND APPENDICEAL ABSCESS .
SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS WAS NONE .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old white female who presented to the Emergency Department at the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Ver Medical Center</PHI> with a chief complaint of diffuse abdominal pain which was periumbilical in origin .
Patient had experienced periumbilical pain which was nonradiating , mild , and stable for approximately three days .
In addition , she had had three days of nausea and vomiting .
She complained of no dysuria and no vaginal or urinary discharge .
Her last meal was on the day of admission .
Her last bowel movement was two days prior to admission and her last menstrual period was on <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 6</PHI> , 1997 .
Patient did note some slight anorexia .
PAST MEDICAL / SURGICAL HISTORY :
Unremarkable .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
She took no medications .
ALLERGIES :
She had no known drug allergies .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She had a temperature of 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit , heart rate 115 , and blood pressure 139/89 .
HEENT :
Oropharynx was clear , extraocular movements were intact , and pupils were equal , round , and reactive to light .
CHEST :
Lungs were clear to auscultation .
HEART :
Regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs , rubs , or gallops .
ABDOMEN :
Positive bowel sounds , nondistended , no hepatosplenomegaly , no costovertebral angle tenderness , no hernia , and no rebound or guarding .
There was mild right lower quadrant and left lower quadrant tenderness and no masses palpable .
RECTAL :
Nontender and hemoccult negative .
PELVIC :
Examination showed no masses and mild cervical motion tenderness .
EXTREMITIES :
No cyanosis , clubbing , or edema .
NEUROLOGICAL :
No focal deficits .
LABORATORY EXAMINATION :
Studies revealed that chemistries were within normal limits , white blood cell count was 20.8000 , hematocrit was 38 , and platelets were 272,000 .
KUB was performed in the Emergency Room which showed dilated loops of small bowel with no air fluid levels .
In addition , an ultrasound was performed of the right lower quadrant which showed no evident appendix .
The pelvis and pelvic structures were normal and there was a normal gallbladder and kidneys seen on the right .
Chest x-ray was unremarkable , urinalysis was negative , and beta HCG was negative .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the hospital with a principle diagnosis of likely perforated appendicitis .
She was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .
On the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .
The colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .
This was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .
There were some bubbles of free air which were thought to be extraluminal .
The primary diagnosis at that time was complicated or perforated appendicitis with partial small bowel obstruction .
A delayed CT scan was planned in order to follow contrast through the lower intestine and on this delayed CT scan , contrast was seen passing distally through the lower intestine .
At this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .
The patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .
Over the first three hospital days , her white blood cell count fell to under 10,000 .
Sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .
Patient &apos;s physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .
After the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .
Repeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .
This CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .
The appendix was not well visualized .
The repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .
These were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .
Given the progression of the patient &apos;s CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .
Patient &apos;s bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .
She experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 3</PHI> , 1997 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Zamorryn He</PHI> .
No ileocecectomy was performed .
Cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .
These peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .
The patient &apos;s perioperative antibiotics ( ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl ) were continued .
The patient tolerated the procedure well and was taken to the Recovery Room then subsequently to the floor .
Pain service consultation was obtained for perioperative pain control and a patient controlled analgesia was begun .
Patient &apos;s nasogastric tube was discontinued on postoperative day one and by postoperative day two , the patient was out of bed and ambulating .
On postoperative day three , the patient was started on oral sips and by postoperative day four , the patient was tolerating over a liter a day of clear liquids and had had one bowel movement .
Her abdominal pain was dramatically decreased at this time .
She had no abdominal distention and no erythema around the wound .
Two Jackson-Pratts were placed intraoperatively .
At the time of this dictation on postoperative day four , the Jackson-Pratts had put out under 5 cc of discharge per day .
The patient is scheduled to be discharged tomorrow on <PHI TYPE="DATE">December 8</PHI> , 1997 .
Her Jackson-Pratt drains will be discontinued in the morning and the patient will be discharged on ofloxacin and Flagyl p.o. for a total antibiotic course of fourteen days which includes an additional nine days of antibiotics with the patient &apos;s operative date being considered day one of antibiotics .

FOCAL NECROTIC GLOMERULONEPHRITIS .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
Patient is a 51 year old female with a history of diabetes mellitus who presented with pain in her stomach times two weeks and was noted to have a very increased BUN and creatinine in the Emergency Room .
The patient was in her usual state of very good health until about two weeks ago .
She had never been hospitalized .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">November 29</PHI> , 1996 through <PHI TYPE="DATE">Christmas</PHI> , 1996 , the patient went to <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Burg</PHI> and she said that the last two weeks in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Burg</PHI> , she had neck pain on the right and some pain her throat .
She received a shot of an unknown medication as well as pills which she believed were Keflex but vomited each time she took the pills so she only took these for three days and did not complete her whole course of antibiosis .
The patient &apos;s neck pain resolved some but she began coughing and her throat still hurt .
In three days , she also started to have some upper abdominal pain , constant burning with eating , and also , she had some vomiting .
She was able to keep fluids down .
The patient saw a <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Burgan</PHI> medical doctor on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25</PHI>/96 for throat and belly pain and received another shot in each leg .
She also had some intermittent loose stool with no melena or bright red blood per rectum .
The patient &apos;s emesis was yellow and her cough was productive of sputum .
On work-up in the Emergency Room on the day of admission , the patient was found to have a BUN and creatinine of 65 and 9.1.
Her primary medical doctor was called and reported this was absolutely new .
She received one liter of normal saline , Demerol , Vistaril , Maalox .
Patient &apos;s last menstrual period was the week before , she had no dysuria , no headache , no vaginal discharge , and no swelling of her legs , and no blood in her urine .
She had been drinking coconut water soda and was not really eating solids .
She had some fatigue and some thirst but no history of any rashes .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
Significant for adult onset diabetes mellitus since 1993 and also status post surgery for an ectopic pregnancy in the past .
CURRENT MEDICATIONS :
Glucotrol 5 q.d. , Keflex , and an unknown antacid .
ALLERGIES :
She had no drug allergies .
SOCIAL HISTORY :
She did not use alcohol , was born in <PHI TYPE="LOCATION">Burg</PHI> , and was a domestic worker .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
She was a generally tired appearing female in no acute distress .
Her vital signs were temperature 97.4 , pulse of 72 , blood pressure was 156/90 , and 95% on room air .
HEENT :
Examination was completely unremarkable with a non-traumatic head , extraocular movements were intact , pupils equally round and reactive to light , clear oropharynx , no sinus tenderness , and mucous membranes were slightly dry .
NECK :
Showed no lymphadenopathy and was supple .
LUNGS :

CARDIAC :
Examination showed a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 , and no murmurs , gallops , or rubs .
ABDOMEN :
Obese , non-tender , non-distended , no hepatosplenomegaly but the examination was limited secondary to habitus , and no fluid wave .

Her PT and PTT were 11.9 and 25.6 and her INR was 1 .
Her urinalysis was pending at the time of admission , chest x-ray was pending , and EKG was normal with maybe a downgoing T in III and V1 .
Her ultrasound showed a normal gallbladder , normal pancreas , maybe some mild infiltration of her liver , no hydronephrosis , and the kidneys were not noted .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Basically on admission , it was somewhat unclear what was the etiology of both her hyponatremia as well as her high creatinine .
The patient , of course , was seen by Renal and a renal biopsy was discussed .
Renal biopsy was done on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/27</PHI>/96 and was uncomplicated .
The results showed focal necrotizing glomerulonephritis with crescents and was ? _ ? immune .
Patient was given cyclophosphamide 980 mg intravenously times one , Solu-Medrol one gram intravenously q.d. times three days , and she was started on Amphojel , nephrocaps , and calcium carbonate .
She was kept on a fluid restriction of 1000 cc per day for her poor urine output .
Patient was also put on a renal diet .
Patient had symptoms of epigastric pain , nausea , and vomiting probably secondary to her medications .
Slowly , however , that resolved and also , she had some encouraging signs of diuresis with decrease in creatinine and some improvement of her symptoms .
She continued to do quite well with her creatinine lowering finally to 2.8 on <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/04</PHI>/97 .
The patient was therefore discharged feeling relatively well with her decreased creatinine .
DISPOSITION :
She will be followed up by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Na Fongbain</PHI> and she will also have a <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">HMC</PHI> two times a day to help her with insulin which she had necessitated since she had been started on Prednisone 60 mg q.d.
The patient is discharged <PHI TYPE="DATE">01/05</PHI>/97 .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a seventy two year old female with multiple cardiac risk factors and Barrett &apos;s esophagitis who was discharged from <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital</PHI> on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 28</PHI> , 1999 after admission for chest pain of uncertain etiology , but an exercise tolerance test with Adenosine MIBI showed a mild reversible perfusion defect posterolaterally .
The patient &apos;s medication regimen was augmented .
See details in discharge summary of <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 26</PHI> , to <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 28</PHI> , 1999 .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 29</PHI> , 1999 the patient had her typical tingling across the chest with left arm pain several hours after cleaning house and going out to lunch .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 30th</PHI> , the following morning , she wakened with her symptoms , but they progressed to substernal chest pain and nausea .
Nitroglycerin sublingual x three failed to relieve symptoms and she was referred to the nearest emergency room , which was at <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lu Son Medical Center</PHI> hospital .
There her Electrocardiogram was interpreted as showing inferolateral changes .
She was transferred to <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Daughtersvillshamen&apos;s Hospital</PHI> for cardiac catheterization .
On review of her Electrocardiogram here there did not appear to be a significant changes .
Specifically , the T wave inversion in F was more distinct than on previous Electrocardiogram here , but was in the direction of the R-wave vector .
Other changes were consistent with lead placement .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY / FAMILY HISTORY / SOCIAL HISTORY :
See discharge summary of <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 26</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">Jun 28</PHI> , 1999 .
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :
Pindolol 10 milligrams po b.i.d. , Transderm nitro .1 milligrams / hour .
Aspirin ( on hold pending repeat EGD ) , Lipitor 20 milligrams po q p.m. , nitroglycerin sublingual PRN , Premarin .9 milligrams a day , Bactrim DS b.i.d. for seven days .
ALLERGIES :
Ampicillin associated with hives , Detrol may have caused fluid retention , calcium channel blockers avoided because of Barrett &apos;s esophagitis .
SBE prophylaxis for mild MR an AI .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
Blood pressure 152/50 , heart rate 80 , respirations 15 , temperature 97.7 , carotids II+ without bruits , no jugular venous distention , lungs clear , core regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 , S2 , no murmurs , gallops or rubs .
Extremity pulses all intact , 1+ ankle edema .
Neurologic intact .
LABORATORY :
Sodium 134 , potassium 4.3 , Electrocardiogram normal sinus rhythm with normal intervals , non-specific T wave changes .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
Impression was of a chest pain again with typical and atypical features in a patient with coronary artery disease documented by stress test with MIBI , multiple cardiac risk factors and Barrett &apos;s esophagitis .
Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Barrett</PHI> was consulted for an opinion in fact whether it was warranted to proceed with cardiac catheterization given the overall picture as well as the patient &apos;s reluctance due to her sister &apos;s recently having had an acute myocardial infarction while undergoing cardiac catheterization .
On <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Barrett</PHI> &apos;s recommendation , cardiac catheterization was performed .
Angiogram showed entirely clear coronary arteries with a right dominant system .
It was concluded that the patient &apos;s chest pain was esophageal in origin . ( Interestingly , her sister who had the myocardial infarction during cardiac catheterization also had an angiogram showing clear coronaries according to the patient ) .
The patient was still awaiting her esophagogastroduodenoscopy with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Gootzfrier</PHI> .
Results were discussed with the patient and her ongoing therapy reviewed .
In view of the catheterization results , the patient opted to discontinue her Lipitor for now .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Chest pain with reversible defect on recent exercise tolerance test Adenosine MIBI and normal coronary angiography .
Other diagnoses as in past medical history ( see discharge summary of <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/26</PHI> to <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/28</PHI>/99 ) .

PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
30 WEEKS GESTATION , PREMATURE LABOR
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
30 WEEKS GESTATION , PREMATURE LABOR STATUS POST CESAREAN SECTION
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 31 year old gravida-2 para-0 with a known twin gestation with an estimated date of confinement of <PHI TYPE="DATE">02/27</PHI>/98 .
On the day of admission , the patient had an ultrasound which showed the infants to be in the breech /vertex presentation .
Also noted on ultrasound was a shortened cervix at 1.8 centimeters and funneling of the lower uterine segment .
The patient was admitted to the triage area of labor and delivery and noted to be having contractions every two minutes .
She was given one dose of terbutaline with a subsequent tachycardia to 120 .
She was then started on magnesium sulfate with a 4 gram bolus followed by two grams per hour .
This seemed to decrease the frequency of her contractions significantly and she was only having a rare contraction .
Her cervix on admission was closed and about 80 percent effaced .
She was given betamethasone and transferred to the antenatal unit .
She did well for the first two days with only minor complaints of irregular contractions .
On the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24</PHI>/98 she seemed to be having more contractions and pelvic exam revealed the cervix to be one centimeter , 80 percent effaced .
Consultation was obtained with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Lou</PHI> who suggested at least briefly increasing the infusion rate to see if her pregnancy could be prolonged longer .
She seemed to respond to this with only irregular contractions .
On the evening of <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/24</PHI>/98 , the patient once again complained of increasing contraction frequency as well as back pain .
Examination revealed the cervix to now be 2-3 centimeters dilated and the decision was made to discontinue the magnesium and to perform delivery .
She had a primary Cesarean section because of the breech presentation and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">Christmas</PHI> she underwent uncomplicated primary Monroe Kerr Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia .
At 2:10 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25</PHI>/98 the patient was delivered of a 3 pound 5 ounce male infant with Apgars of 7 at one and 8 at five minutes .
At 2:12 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/25</PHI>/98 she was delivered of a male infant weighing 3 pounds and 3 ounces in the vertex position with Apgars of 7 at one and 7 at five minutes .
Both infants were transferred to the Neonatal intensive care unit and were doing well at the time of the maternal discharge .
She did well postoperatively with minimal discomfort .
On the morning of discharge , the patient complained of a warm swollen area on the posterior aspect of her left knee .
Consultation was obtained with the cardiovascular group and the decision was that she had superficial phlebitis of her left leg which could be treated conservatively and would not require Heparin .
The patient was discharged on <PHI TYPE="DATE">12/29</PHI>/98 and is to be seen in the office in two weeks .
She was discharged with prescriptions for Motrin and Tylenol and Peri-Colace as needed .
She is to attemp elevation , heatetc to her left leg understanding that she will be coming to see her infants in the NICU .

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
This 35-year-old female had a history of bilateral severe hearing loss since the age of four , which worsened several years ago .
This was evaluated by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rybam Selcjescpint</PHI> beginning in the early 1990s. The diagnosis of atypical Meniere &apos;s disease was made .
A CT scan without contrast in 1991 was reported to be normal .
She reported there was still some sound perception in the left ear , although it was not useful hearing .
In the right ear , she used a hearing aid , which helped her .
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/16</PHI>/97 , she awakened with tingling and numbness involving first her left arm , then the leg , then the face , associated with mild headache and nausea .
The numbness persisted .
No focal objective neurological deficit was found .
Magnetic resonance imaging showed findings consistent with an acoustic neuroma in the left cerebellar pontine angle extending approximately 3 centimeters into the posterior fossa .
There was a cystic component on the medial superior aspect of the tumor .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
There was severe loss of hearing in both ears .
No other focal neurological deficit was found .
HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :
On <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/18</PHI>/97 , a left suboccipital craniotomy was done , and in conjunction with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Rybam Selcjescpint</PHI> and Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Zette Breunelksbelb</PHI> , total removal of an acoustic neuroma was accomplished .
The facial nerve was markedly involved with the tumor .
Only a portion of the fibers could be kept intact , and the rest were reapproximated .
Postoperatively , she had complete facial paralysis .
The patient was seen in consultation by Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Yertrey Sumchirdkaysmavveindreps</PHI> of the Ocular Plastic Service , and on <PHI TYPE="DATE">6/19</PHI>/97 , a gold weight was placed in the left upper eyelid .
Her overall course was one of rapid improvement .
There was minimal incoordination of the left upper extremity .
She ambulated initially with help , but this was rapidly improving .
There was no evidence of cerebral spinal fluid leak .
The incision was healing well at the time of discharge .
FINAL DIAGNOSIS :
1 ) Left acoustic neuroma .
2 ) Left facial paralysis .
3 ) Atypical Meniere &apos;s disease .

A 24-hour Holter is pending ; the Pt was in NSR on EKGs , and was ruled-out for MI by cardiac enzymes .
Pt was seen by PT and OT who have recommended acute rehabilitation .
Clinically , the Pt improved during the hospital course , with residual mild R nasolabial fold flattening , 4+/5 strength proximally of the right arm and leg ; she is slightly weaker distally with 3/5 of the interosseous muscles on the right .
IMPRESSION :
This is a 67 y / o woman with poorly controlled HTN , hyperlipidemia and hypothyroidism , who presented with a lacunar stroke , most likely due to HTN .
Given her fairly young age , investigation of cardioembolic sources was pursued and not found by TTE , though a Holter report is still pending .
Secondary prevention will include improved BP treatment ( added ACE ) , cholesterol treatment ( added statin ) , treatment of high homocystine with B vitamins , and a switch from ASA to Aggrenox .
She is being discharged to rehab and will F / U in the neurology clinic in 4-6 weeks .

ADMITTING DIAGNOSIS :
1. Visceral segment aorticpseudoaneurysm .
2. Severe restrictive pulmonary disease secondary to kyphosis .
DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
Same .
ADMITTING SURGEON :
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Nonok Ayrekempe</PHI> , M.D.
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 78-year-old man who was diagnosed with a very large perirenal abdominal aortic pseudo- aneurysm on a CT scan that was ordered in the setting of dyspnea in .
The patient did have a history of previous AAA repair , and the CT revealed a large pseudoaneurysm in the area of the prior proximal anastomosis .
Given the size of the aneurysm , the patient was scheduled for a repair of the pseudoaneurysm .
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :
1. Peripheral vascular disease .
2. History of DVT .
3. History of PE in 1997 .
4. Paraesophageal hernia .
5. History of TB which was treated in 1950&apos;s.
6. Kyphosis and osteoporosis .
7. Gastroesophageal reflux disease .
8. Upper GI bleed in 1997 .
9. Occasional dyspnea with mild aortic insufficiency .
PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :
1. Triple-A repair in 1999 .
2. Paraesophageal hernia repair in 1997 .
3. ORIF of left hip in 1975 .
MEDICATIONS AT HOME :
1. Atenolol 50 q.d.
2. Fosamax 70 q.week .
3. Hydrochlorothiazide 20 q.d.
4. Nexium 20 q.d.
5. Zocor 20 q.h.s.
6. MVI q.d.
ALLERGIES :
No known drug allergies .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was taken to the operating room on <PHI TYPE="DATE">8/16</PHI>/04 where he underwent an exploratory laparotomy with attempted repair of a perirenal aortic aneurysm which was subsequently aborted given the patient &apos;s complex aortic anatomy and the extensive scar encountered .
The patient was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .
Please see operative note for more details .
The patient &apos;s postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .
The patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .
This was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .
The patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .
This was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .
However , on the morning of <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/5</PHI>/04 the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .
The patient was intubated and placed on pressors after administration of the ACLS protocol .
The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .
After his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .
Cardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .
Decision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .
Multiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .
After extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .
The patient &apos;s daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .
Despite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on <PHI TYPE="DATE">9/5</PHI>/04 .
The family was at the bedside at this time .
The medical examiner has been contacted and a post has been requested .

ATTENDING :
<PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">CRILI THONTA TLANDBINDE</PHI> MD
PRINCIPAL DIAGNOSIS :
Miller-Fisher variant Guillain Barre syndrome .
Sixth nerve palsy .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
The patient is a 45-year-old male who complained of a 2-day history of horizontal diplopia that began in rightward gaze and was now present bilaterally .
Of note , the patient reports a 2-week history of upper respiratory infection and sinus congestion .
He reports that the day before admission , he awoke with diplopia that did resolve with monocular vision .
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :
The patient had pupils that were equal , round , and reactive to light bilaterally .
Accommodation was intact .
Visual fields were full by confrontation .
Of note , there was right than greater than left abducens weakness noted by the physical examiner on admission .
His strength in his extremities was normal and he had normal reflexes .
MRI of the brain demonstrated significant right sphenoid maxillary and ethmoid sinus inflammation .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
Procedures :
The patient was evaluated initially by the Otolaryngology Service with the consideration that his right-sided sinus disease was contributing to his sixth nerve palsy .
He was started on antibiotic treatment for his sinus findings .
However , further review by Neurology Consult Service indicated that the sinus disease was likely not sufficient to explain the patient &apos;s cranial nerve findings .
The working diagnosis at that point was the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome versus less likely causes .
The patient underwent lumbar puncture and also had an electromyelogram performed .
EMG findings were in fact consistent with variant Guillain-Barre syndrome .
It was then determined that the patient should be started on intravenous immunoglobulin .
He was therefore started with a treatment course of 6 days of IV IgA after obtaining an IgA level .
The patient tolerated this treatment course well .
His cranial neuropathy was monitored carefully and was found to be stable to slightly improving in the first several days of treatment .
He was also treated with IV steroids .
By <PHI TYPE="DATE">08/20</PHI>/2003 , the patient has tolerated the full treatment course and had a substantial improvement in his diplopia .
It was then determined that the patient was safe to discharge .
DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :
1. Tylenol 650 mg p.o. q. 4-6 hours p.r.n. pain .
2. Hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg p.o. q.d.
3. Lopressor 25 mg p.o. b.i.d.
FOLLOW UP :
The plan for follow up was with Dr. <PHI TYPE="DOCTOR">Viennee Breutzfreierm</PHI> within 14 days of discharge .

DISCHARGE DIAGNOSIS :
#1. Malignant neoplasm of the esophagus .
#2. Chronic blood loss anemia .
#3. Secondary malignant neoplasm of the liver .
#4. Secondary malignant neoplasm of the lung .
#5. pulmonary emboli and infarction .
#6. Esophageal hemorrhage .
#7. hypo-osmolality .

#9. Hypothyroidism .
#10. noninsulin dependent diabetes mellitus .
#11. Adult failure to thrive .
PROCEDURE :
Radiotherapy to the esophagus on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/13</PHI>/03 for four consecutive days .
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :
One of several admissions for this 72 year-old female with metastatic unresectable esophageal cancer who is admitted with generalized upper abdominal pain of several days duration .
We have been seeing her fairly frequently in clinic , trying to give her some palliative chemotherapy which did not seem to work ( platinum and 5FU ) and she has had an anemia requiring transfusions on a regular basis every few weeks with heme positive stools .
On the days leading up to her admission she had not had many bowel movements but forced one with laxatives the night before admission .
The abdominal pain was slightly better after defecation but was not really influenced much by position or eating .
The bowel movement was dark .
She had nausea .
She was regurgitating some of her saliva from the lesion in her esophagus that was preventing her from swallowing .
She had some dyspnea that was continuing in spite of transfusions .
Her exam showed a blood pressure of 126/68 , heart rate 72 and regular , temperature 98.8 .
Her pain level was rated a 5 out of 10 .
She was pale and exhausted .
Old ecchymoses from a recent fall were resolving on her face and the laceration on her nasal bridge was also covered with scab .
Her tongue was moist .
Her JVP was less than 6 cm .
Her lungs were clear .
There was a 3/6 systolic ejection murmur at the base .
Her abdomen was softly protuberant .
There was a few tingling bowel sounds .
The liver is 10 below the right costal margin at the MCL , firm and tender .
No hepatic rub .
Rectal ; good tone , empty vault but the material present is dark brown and guaiac positive .
Neuro exam ; positive for generalized weakness / deconditioning , but cranial nerves and mentation were intact .
LABORATORY DATA :
Included an abdominal film that showed nonspecific gas pattern .
Her sodium was 130 , potassium 4.2 , her BUN was 27 , creatinine 0.8 .
Her plasma glucose was 409 , her albumin 1.6 .
Her alk phos 816 .
ALT 53 , AST 113 , LDH 699 , white blood count was 17.3 with 85 polys , 12 lymphs , no bands .
Her crit was 21.6 and her platelets were 100,000 .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was brought into the hospital and begun on IV fluids along with some clear liquids if she could tolerate them and her condition did not really improve , although she would keep reporting that each day she was a little bit better .
She was really too weak to get out of bed .
She only picked at her food and still had some dysphagia for solids .
Because of ongoing gastrointestinal bleeding and transfusions , we suspected that the esophageal lesion itself was probably the source of this bleeding and perhaps some palliative radiation therapy would both open the sphincter area for swallowing and staunch the bleeding .
To that end , external beam radiation therapy was begun and she tolerated it fairly well .
Some episodes of nausea , but only received about four or five doses of it without any marked change in how she felt .
Over this period of time , there has been tentative plans to try to get her closer to home to the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Lida Shonic,nsol Memorial Hospital</PHI> home or even to her own home , to be able to died in her own bed but this was not possible because the family felt uncertain about being able to provide enough safe care for her , even for a brief period of time .
Ultimately she became jaundiced and encephalopathic and the decision was to let her stay in the hospital .
She had previously established that she did not want resuscitation or intubation and this was abided by and she passed away in her sleep at 6:45 am on <PHI TYPE="DATE">5/22</PHI>/03 .
The family was not interested in having an autopsy .
