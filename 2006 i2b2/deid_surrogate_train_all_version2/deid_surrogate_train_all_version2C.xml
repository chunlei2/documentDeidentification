On physical examination he is a tachypneic white male on 40 percent face mask with oxygen saturations 98 percent .

His oropharynx was clear .
He had no gag .
His fundus was poorly seen .
He did count fingers in both eyes at one foot .
He had 2+ carotids on time without bruits .
The jugular venous pressure was 6 .
He had a scar that was healing in the left neck .
His heart rate was regular rate and rhythm .
He had diffuse rhonchi and upper airway noises .
His abdomen was benign .
He had guaiac positive brown stool with a normal prostate .
His neurological examination was remarkable for a mildly encephalopathic male .
He was oriented times two .
He thought he was in &quot; <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">Em Nysonken Medical Center</PHI> &quot; .
He moved extremities times four .
His reflexes were 2+ and symmetric .
His toes were down going .
LABORATORY DATA :
Four liter arterial blood gas of 71/43/7.45 , ionized calcium 1.03 , normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine 16/1.4 , glucose 246 , calc , mag and phos normal , albumin 2.2 , LDH 227 , liver function tests normal , white count 10.6 , hematocrit 32 which was 31 on the 19th and 38 on the 16th , prothrombin time 9.9 , partial thromboplastin time 26 .
Cultures of the blood , urine and sputum were pending at that time .
A sputum gram stain showed moderate polys with few gram negative rods .
A chest X-ray showed bilateral opacities in the bases with increased interstitial markings .
An electrocardiogram on admission to the CCU showed normal sinus , 90 beats per minute , with a normal axis , normal intervals , an old inferior myocardial infarction and up sloping ST depressions with V2 to V4 with increased rate .
These improved with decreased rate .
HOSPITAL COURSE :
The patient was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit and placed on Unasyn for a question of aspiration pneumonia .
He was also placed on intravenous nitroglycerin , oxygen and aspirin for his coronary ischemia .
No heparin was given because of his esophageal laceration .
No beta blocker was given because of his history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
The patient remained stable in the Coronary Care Unit and was transferred to the floor on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">23rd</PHI> on aspirin , Carafate , intravenous Haldol , nebs , Unasyn , NPH with CZI sliding coverage , morphine , Compazine and intravenous Benadryl .
His blood gas at that time on 40 percent face mask was 84 , 42 , 7.48 .
His hematocrit was 28 at the time of transfer .
He was still guaiac positive at that time .
His mental status was improved from admission to the CCU .
The patient did well on the floor initially with improvement in his arterial blood gases and mental status .
However , on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">24th</PHI> he had a massive upper GI bleed .
He was taken for esophagogastroduodenoscopy by the Surgical Service after elective intubation for airway control .
There was large fresh clot covering the lower part of the esophagus starting at 35 cm and extending distally to the esophagogastric junction along the left curvature side of the stomach .
The clot was dense despite multiple attempts at lavage .
There was no lesion noted in the stomach .
The pylorus was entered and the first and second portion of the duodenum were inspected and were seen to be normal .
The scope was retroflexed in the antrum where it showed a normal fundus of the stomach and normal esophagogastric junction .
It was felt the patient &apos;s GI bleeding was secondary to his previously known esophageal tear .
He was readmitted to the Coronary Care Unit on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">25th</PHI> , where initially he was stable .
His aspirin was discontinued .
He was continued on the intravenous Cimetidine and Carafate except that he was made NPO .
He was transfused to keep hematocrit greater than 30 .
He was seen in consultation by the <PHI TYPE="HOSPITAL">OLH</PHI> Service , who felt he was a candidate for total parenteral nutrition .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">25th</PHI> he developed progressive hypotension with evidence of further upper gastrointestinal bleeding .
He was intubated for airway protection .
An electrocardiogram at that time showed a right rate related right bundle and apical ST changes consistent with ischemia .
Repeat endoscopy was unsuccessful because of severe bleeding despite massive lavage .
A pneumothorax was noted on his chest X-ray on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">25th</PHI> and a chest tube was placed .
On the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> , because of continued massive bleeding , he was taken by Vascular Radiology for a question of embolization .
Three sites of active extravasation were found , one from the gastroesophageal junction area and two from the gastric fundus .
All sites were successfully embolized with Gelfoam with non-selective arterial embolization of the spleen occurring as well .
No varices were noted .
Severe right external iliac stenosis was noted .
The patient returned to the floor on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> with improved hemodynamics .
He was continued to be managed with packed red blood cells , platelets and fresh frozen plasma .
He was continued to be intubated with poor mental status .
He was paralyzed for the vascular procedure .
A head computerized tomography scan on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> showed a probable right cerebellar infarct and a question of a right middle cerebral artery infarct .
Given the multi organ system failure on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">26th</PHI> the family was consulted regarding his dismal prognosis and they decided to make the patient do not resuscitate without further pressures or aggressive measures with comfort care being paramount .
The patient continued to have bleeding with progressive downward deterioration of his mental status and renal failure and temperature spikes .
The patient died on the <PHI TYPE="DATE">31st</PHI> .
No cardiopulmonary resuscitation was performed as per the patient and family wishes .
