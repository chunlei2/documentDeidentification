	Interval History:

   Ms. Kong presents to follow-up her recent hospitalizations.  Briefly, she was admitted in early April with Group B strep bacteremia and AoV endocarditis with mod to severe AI.  The source of GBS bacteremia remains unclear although she had an episode of shingles a few weeks prior and may have caused a cutaneous innoculation.  Pre-op angiogram showed no significant CAD.  On 4/5/89 she underwent composite aortic root replacement with a 20mm life net aortic homograft by Dr. Jerome.  Due to heavily calcified RCA ostium, a button for re-implantation couldn't be created so she recieved a single vessel SVG to prox RCA.  Post op course was complicated by afib with high grade AV block for which she recieved a dual chamber PPM.  She was discharged to rehab with a PICC to complete a course of IV PCN.  However, she was re-admitted in early May while still at rehab with an episode of chest pain at rest.  ECG was paced but biomarkers were mildly positive (troponin ~0.5).  TTE showed the valve was well seated without suggestion of recurrent endocarditis.  There was a new apical WMA.  She underwent cath which showed patent BPG and no significant CAD.  The episode was attributed to embolic phenomenon (? from afib, INR 1.5 on admission).  She was discharged back to rehab and has done well since.



She was seen in the ID clinic and the PICC line was pulled.  She's back home from rehab now and seems to be fairly well.  She gets fatigued easily and has to rest after walking about a 100 yards.  However, she denies CP, SOB, palpitations, presyncope or focal neurologic deficits.  No F/C or weight loss.  She has a long history of bilateral calf caludication but she isn't exerting herself enough to elicit symptoms.  While at rehab, she was sleeping on 4 pillows and would develop orthopnea if sleeping flat.  Now she's sleeping on 2 pillows for comfort and doesn't seem to have anymore orthopnea.  However, she does experience what sounds like PND a couple of times per week.  She denies LE edema.  She's tolerating all medications well.  Home BS checks have been running 90-130.

   A-V sequentially paced at 70



	Impression:

   Overall, Ms. Kong seems to be recovering quite well after a difficult couple of months.  Her exercise tolerance is fairly poor, likely reflecting deconditioning.  To that end, I've referred her to the cardiac rehab program at Glenbeigh Hospital (closer to home).



She has occasional episodes of possible PND but no other evidence of volume overload on exam.  If her symptoms persist, I've asked her to notify me and we'll try a low dose of lasix.



In terms of rhythm issues, she is now completely paced.  She probably doesn't need amio anymore so we'll stop it today.  In terms of coumadin, it's probably reasonable to continue for 3 months following valve replacement.  She's due to see Dr. Jerome next month; we'll defer to him in terms of the duration of post-op anti-coagulation from a bioprosthetic valve perspective.  With regard to Afib, she had post-op Afib but now she's atrially paced.  If future PPM interogations don't reveal underlying Afib, she may not need coumadin in the long run.



She'll return to clinic in 6 months or sooner prn.  Seen with Dr. Richard Oden.
