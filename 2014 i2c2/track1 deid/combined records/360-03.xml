Mr. Geiger is a 75 year old man with a history of hypertension, 
hyperlipidemia and panhypopituitarism who comes in today for 
follow up of his blood pressure.  We have been titrating up his 
blood pressure meds over the past week.  He is gone from 50mg of 
atenolol to 75 to 100mg with steady improvement in his blood 
pressure.  His current regimen is atenolol 100q.d., HCTZ 25 q.d., 
lisinopril 20mg q.d.  The patient has had no dizziness or other 
symptoms with increasing doses of atenolol.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His blood pressure is 160/94.  Heart rate 
is 64.  Carotids 2+ without bruits.  Lungs clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  Cardiac exam: regular rate and rhythm, normal S1, 
S2 with no murmurs.  Abdomen is benign.  Extremities: no edema.  

Laboratories:  Cholesterol from June 11, 2077: total 171, HDL 57, 
LDL 86. 

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Mr. Geiger is a very pleasant 75 year old 
man with hypertension, hyperlipidemia.
1. 	Hypertension.  Blood pressure still elevated.  I will increase 
lisinopril to 30mg q.d.  Will also check a set of electrolytes 
at his next visit in 2 weeks when his blood pressure will be 
followed up.
2. 	Cholesterol.  Well controlled at this time.
3. 	Health maintenance.  The patient denies any colonoscopy in the 
past.  I do not see one on record or in his history.  We will 
arrange a screening colonoscopy.  The patient has had recent 
PSA of 2.8 and a normal prostate exam by me last year.  He is 
due for annual physical next month and will schedule this.
