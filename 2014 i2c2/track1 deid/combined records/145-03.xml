    NORMAL FLORA PRESENT



A/P: 61 yr old female with likely bacterial respiratory infection in the setting of longstanding bronchiectasis. She has failed a recent course of Telithromycin in the setting of moraxella culture positive sputum. We will repeat sputum cultures and start vancomycin and ceftriaxone IV here. We will get Chest Films and supplement her home pulmonary regimen with Nebulized albuterol q 4 hrs.  I have encouraged frequent ambulation. She will continue to use her home flutter valve. Her husband provides Chest PT at home and we may order this if appropriate in house.



We will continue her home Inderal at 240 mg qd. This will be supplemented with an ACE I and hydralazine as necessary. The use of an ACE I will be discussed with her PCP as this may have been avoided second to chronic cough. She is not a candidate for Lasix or HCTZ due to her sulfa allergy. Her admission BP of 187/97 was in the setting of a delay in today's dose of inderal. She was asymptomatic with this high pressure. 



We will continue her hormone replacement, GERD prophylaxis with nexium and nightly nortryptiline.  She will be ambulatory and not require DVT prophylaxis.
