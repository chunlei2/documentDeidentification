NEUROLOGY RESIDENT CONSULT NOTE 





PATIENT NAME: Dalila Haynes
MRN: 78361343
DATE OF CONSULT: 1/30/04



 
Consulted by: ED for altered mental status and generalized weakness



HPI:   

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Patient is unable to give a reliable history; history from daughter Inez Haynes, whom I called on the phone, and from LMR (primarily Dr. Keondre Viera's August neurology note). Her daughter reports that current decline is similar to her presentation in July 2103.


She was hospitalized at Promptcare in July 2103 for evaluation of mental and motor slowing, memory loss, and weight loss that had progressed over 1 to 2 months. Head CT on 7/25/03 with only mild ventriculomegaly. An MRI of the brain on 7/28 showed a few dots of restricted diffusion in the left thalamus. There was no abnormal enhancement. This was consistent with small vessel stroke. EEG showed generalized slowing of the background in the theta and delta range with no epileptiform features. She had normal vitamin B12, folate, TSH, and ESR (20). CSF HSV PCR was negative. HbA1C was elevated at 8.6. An LP showed normal glucose (74), elevated protein (102), lymphocytic pleocytosis (18-20 WBC, 56-69% lymphocytes, 29-40% monocytes, and 2-4% neutrophils) and 0-1 RBC. CSF ACE was normal. Cultures were negative. CSF VDRL was negative. She was initially treated with prednisone 40 mg daily tapered down to 10 mg daily. In follow up, it was noted that RPR was non-reactive, a TA-IgG was positive, and the confirming treponemal tests (FTA) was also positive at the state lab. This was thought to represent neurosyphillis and she was admitted and treated w/ 14 days of IV penicillin. Prednisone was subsequently tapered to off since her presentation was thought to be consistent w/ neurosyphillis and not neurosarcoidosis.



Per her daughter, patient had improved back to being independent of ADL's and walking with a cane witout assistance. Over the last few weeks, she has gotten progressively more weak with multiple falls. Has trouble standing now, seems unsteady on her feet, has been primarily in bed for the last few days, requiring assistance to get to the bathroom or she falls down. Over the last several days, she has become even more globally weak and confused. She has been talking about relatives who are not in the house, thinking that they are there; thinking that the closet is the bathroom. It was a slow progression over a few weeks and then accelerated over the last few days. Patient reports intermittent headaches.


On presentation to the ED, she was noted to be tachycardic in the 120's (baseline resting tachycardia documented for many months, being worked up by cards), normotensive, afebrile, oriented x 2, and moving all extremities.

IMAGING:
HEAD CT TODAY:
There is no midline shift, mass effect, evidence of acute territorial infarction, or hemorrhage. Ventricles and sulci are prominent consistent with stable involutional change. There is no hydrocephalus. Chronic periventricular white matter changes are again noted. There is no significant soft tissue swelling or calvarial fracture. Prominent calcifications of a falx cerebri are incidentally noted. Imaged portions of the paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear. There is bilateral exophthalmus.
      
CXR: today
Faint opacity seen in the retrocardiac region which  could represent early pneumonia. Clinical correlation and interval follow-up is recommended.


EKG: sinus tachy. no ST changes or Q waves. 



ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 

69 yo F h/o systemic sarcoidosis (extensive adenopathy in the chest, abdomen, and adrenal glands, and has been on corticosteroids), CNS syphillis s/p treatment  who presents with several weeks of increasing generalized weakness and several days of increasing confusion. Exam notable for poor memory and some confusion about recent events.  Labs are unremarkable except minor electrolyte abnormalities. Head CT unremarkable. Her prior presentation was thought to be most likely due to neurosyphillis as detailed above, though there was still the possibility of neurosarcoid. She has not had a repeat LP to assess for resolution of prior abnormalities, and now that she has a recurrence of symptoms, she should have repeat LP. She should also have an MRI as a thalamic or frontal stroke is another possible etiology. This could be a more global failure to thrive in the setting of deconditioning followed by poor PO's, but this should be a diagnosis of exclusion. CXR raises a question of retrocardiac opacity suggesting possible PNA, but with normal WBC, no URI sx's or cough, and no fever, I think it is unlikely that she has PNA and will follow clinically.


-check her gait
-check ESR



-LP for standard studies and save 5-10 cc for additional studies depending on cell count/TP
-MRI of the brain
-EEG
-further lab w/u pending LP results
-remove foley catheter
-PT consult
