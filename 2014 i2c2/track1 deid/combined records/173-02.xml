RE: Otis Narvaez

        MR   #04561326

 

Dear Dr. Huynh:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing your patient Mr. Oscar Narvaez in 

consultation.  As you know he is a 63-year-old gentleman with a history 

of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity.  Recently, he underwent 

evaluation prior to intestinal bypass surgery in which he underwent 

dobutamine stress echocardiography.  The echocardiogram revealed reduced 

left ventricular dysfunction with ejection fraction of 35 to 40 percent.  

There was no evidence of ischemia.  He subsequently underwent coronary 

catheterization.  I do not have those results, but he claims that he was 

told that he had no arterial blockages.  Symptomatically, he is 

significantly short of breath with minimal exertion.  He has attributed 

this to his weight.  He was started on an ACE inhibitor and diuretic, 

although he has not been taking either of these medications.  Prior to 

his catheterization a chest x-ray revealed a 1.5 cm nodule in the left 

upper lobe of the lung that was not present in 2067.  This was confirmed 

subsequently on CT scan, suggesting that this was most likely a primary 

lung malignancy.  He is therefore scheduled for mediastinoscopy with 

you.

 

His past medical history is remarkable for diabetes, hypertension, low 

back pain, and obesity.

 

Current medications include glucophage 1000 mg po q.d., Ritalin 80 mg po 

q.d., Celexa 10 mg po q.d., Neurontin.  No drug allergies

 

Family history is remarkable for heart disease in his father.

 

Social history: he works as a consultant in the Morris area.  He smoked for 

40 years but quit approximately three years ago.  He drinks rarely, 

although drank heavily in the past.

December 30,  2072                                         

 

Review of systems is remarkable for shortness of breath.  He denies 

gastrointestinal complaints.

 

On physical exam he is obese but well appearing with a blood pressure of 

140/70 and a pulse of 80 and regular.  HEENT is unremarkable, neck 

supple without thyromegaly, no jugular venous distention, carotids full 

without bruits, chest clear to auscultation and percussion.Cardiac exam: 

regular rate and rhythm, PMI nondisplaced, normal heart sounds, no 

murmurs or rubs.  Abdomen benign nontender without hepatosplenomegaly or 

CVA tenderness.  No clubbing cyanosis or edema.  Pulses full.

 

Impression: Mr. Narvaez has evidence of decreased left ventricular 

function by echocardiogram.  By report he has no evidence of coronary 

artery disease, although I have not seen this report myself.  If indeed 

it is true that he has no coronary artery disease, then my guess is that 

this represents a primary cardiomyopathy or cardiomyopathy secondary to 

his diabetes or even his history of alcohol abuse.  In any case, this 

puts them at increased risk for an operation, although probably less so 

than if he had significant coronary disease.  I see no reason why you 

should not proceed with the biopsy that is planned immediately.  Prior 

to his operation, he should be placed on ACE inhibitor and diuretic.  

I'll be happy to continue to see him should he care to transfer his care 

to South Side Hospital.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

 

 

Kevin Y. Kirkpatrick, M.D.
