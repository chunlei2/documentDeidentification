HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 65-year-old female who presents today for hospital followup.



I admitted her to the HH on 10/03/79 with an episode of hypoxemia, which was felt to be secondary to CHF and diastolic dysfunction.  She was discharged to johnson rest home on 10/12/79.  Two hours after arrival, she had a respiratory arrest and was taken to the Intensive Care Unit at Clinica Rovira where she stayed until 11/03/79.  She is extremely difficult to diurese because of her tenuous renal function, this required multiple adjustments of her medication.  Stress test showed no ischemia and echocardiogram showed concentric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal chamber size and systolic function, estimated ejection fraction is 65% as well as biatrial enlargement .  She did well acutely with BiPAP and remains on oxygen.  As part of her workup, she had pulmonary function tests, which showed moderate obstruction without a bronchodilator response and some mild restriction likely due to her obesity.  In addition, she was quite anemic with hematocrit of 19 on presentation.  There was no evidence of hemolysis.  She is mildly iron deficient and colonoscopy showed a tubulovillous adenoma, which was excised as well as  a short area of Barrett's esophagus.  There was no evidence of active bleeding.  She received multiple transfusions throughout her stay and was started on darbepoetin, for what was ultimately felt to be anemia of renal disease.  She was discharged to Lahey Clinic and has just returned home.  Her son, Brendon Ambrose who was the healthcare proxy, is here with her today.



Today, she feels reasonably well.  She is still somewhat weak from the prolonged hospitalization, but is quite enthusiastic about the fact that she lost 30 pounds.  She is taking her medications regularly and remains on 2 liters of oxygen.  She has no chest pain or shortness of breath.  Her diabetes regimen was changed during the hospital, she is still taking 70/30 insulin, but lower dose in the evenings and using a sliding scale of lispro insulin with meals.



Hospital course was complicated by a hospital-acquired pneumonia and urinary tract infection as well.  



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure secondary to diastolic dysfunction, type 2 diabetes, renal insufficiency with baseline creatinine approximately 3, hyperlipidemia, atrial fibrillation, peripheral vascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, peripheral neuropathy, Barrett's esophagus, colon polyps (tubulovillous adenoma 2079), diverticulosis adenoid hypertrophy, humeral fracture, history of marijuana use, history of alcohol abuse.



MEDICATIONS:  Reconciled today, they include:

1.  Aspirin 81 mg daily.

2.  Calcium plus D 1 tablet b.i.d.

3.  Darbepoetin is followed by Dr. Dougherty at St. Mary's.

4.  Iron sulfate 325 mg b.i.d.

5.  Hydralazine 100 mg t.i.d.

6.  Loratadine 10 mg daily.

7.  Metolazone 100 mg daily.

8.  Metoprolol succinate 150 mg daily.

9.  Multivitamin.

10.  Nitroglycerin patch 0.3 mg per hour (3 x 0.1 mg patches).

11.  70/30 NovoLog 60 units in the morning and 35 in the evening.

12.  Omeprazole 20 mg b.i.d.

13.  Potassium chloride 40 mEq t.i.d.

14.  Ropinirole 0.25 mg daily.

15.  Simvastatin 40 mg daily.

16.  Spiriva 1 inhalation daily.

17.  Spironolactone 50 mg daily.

18.  Torsemide 100 mg b.i.d.

19.  Trazodone 25 mg nightly.

20.  B-complex vitamin daily.

21.  Vitamin D3 1000 units daily.

22.  Coumadin as monitored by the Hematology Dept..



ALLERGIES TO MEDICATIONS:  None.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 136/60, pulse 74, temperature 97, and weight 222 pounds.  General appearance:  She looks remarkably well given everything she has gone through.  HEENT is unremarkable.  Neck is supple.  No lymphadenopathy, no JVD.  Lungs are clear.  Heart irregularly irregular without murmurs.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, without organomegaly.  Extremities without edema.



LABORATORIES:  Drawn by the VNA on 01/04/80 shows hematocrit of 28.6, INR 2.1 on December 9, 2079 as well as potassium 3.9 and creatinine 3.2.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Congestive heart failure, diastolic dysfunction.  She is currently euvolemic with a weight of 222 pounds.  She will check daily weights.  I will speak to Dr. Vandiver, her cardiologist whom she is seeing next week about getting her enrolled in the HH Cardiac Rehab Center.  Meanwhile, she will call me for any fluctuations in weight.

2.  Atrial fibrillation, stable and rate controlled.  Coumadin anticoagulation followed by the HH Hematology Department.

3.  COPD, for now, she remains on Spiriva and Flovent as well as oxygen 2 liters per minute.  We will see how she does; she may benefit from a trial of Advair.

4.  Chronic renal insufficiency.  Creatinine at baseline of 3.2.  She will need to be watched closely.  She expressed interest in possibility of her renal transplant should that become necessary.  There has been a question as to whether she has renal artery stenosis based on a Doppler ultrasound done during rehabilitation.  I think this must have been done at Brookwood Hospital because no studies are available in the HH system.  Dr. Dougherty had done MRA a number of years ago, which showed no renal artery stenosis at that time, but her worsening renal function is new.  She is scheduled to see Dr. Dougherty next week and will follow up with her expressly raising this issue.  Her son brought up the issue of perhaps consolidating all her care at the HH ,in particular is seeing a nephrologist here.  She is quite fond of Dr. Dougherty who has cared for her for years, but I think given the complexity of medical care.  this might not be a bad idea.  She is going to discuss with Dr. Dougherty and I will E-mail Dr. Dougherty as well.

5.  GI.  She was noted to have Barrett's esophagus and tubulovillous adenoma on exam and she will need to have followup within 1 year for this.

6.  Heme.  Her anemia is a combination of iron deficiency and anemia of renal disease.  She needed several transfusions during the hospitalization.  She is scheduled to see Hematology at Stone-Wheeling in January.  In the meantime,  I have spoken to Dr. Dougherty who agrees to monitor her in the Renal Department at St. Mary's.  If necessary, they can give her intravenous iron.  I will check a hematocrit and iron stores today and fax them over to Dr. Dougherty.

7.  Health care maintenance.  Labs today.  H1N1 vaccine today.  Son, Brendon Ambrose is her healthcare proxy and I have put his name in the Advanced directive file on the LMR.  She wishes to be full code at present.  I will see her again in 4 weeks.



Visit length 60 minutes.
