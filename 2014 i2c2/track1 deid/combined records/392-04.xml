Vascular Surgery
Millen Service Admission Note


Name: Adair, Helen
MRN: 684-22-67
Date: 4/07/13


Attending: Dr. Salgado
Fellow:  Dr. Cross  
Junior:  Dr. Chandler  


History of Present Illness:  50 yo F with NIDDM, active smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and severe PVD (s/p PTCA and multiple toe amputations for diabetic foot), now presents with worsening wet gangrene.  She first noted drainage from her left great toe five days prior to admission.  This was accompanied by toe swelling, fevers to 100.5 and chills, but she denies pain in her L great toe.  Almost simultaneous with the drainage from her L great toe, she also noted increasing pain from the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of her left forefoot, especially when walking.  She denies any trauma to her left foot.  She reports that the ulcer on her right lateral foot is stable, and she has been dressing it with Panafil ointment as prescribed by Dr. Salgado.  She denies any rest pain, and reports that her prior claudication is almost fully resolved following her R SFA angioplasty last year.  She presented today to Dr. Salgado&#8217;s clinic for routine follow-up, when wet gangrene of her L great toe was detected on clinical exam.  Furthermore, she underwent repeat A-LENIs that demonstrated a major decline in the ABI of her R leg, suggestive of worsening peripheral vascular disease.  She is now admitted for parenteral antibiotics and amputation of the L great toe and debridement of the R forefoot ulcer.

Prior ankle/brachial index (ABI) was .69.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal artery/tibial vessel  at rest.  The toe/brachial index is 0.LEFT:  The patient is s/p a left superficial femoral artery pta and stent since last exam.  The ankle/brachial index (ABI) is .81.  Prior ankle/brachial  index (ABI) was .55.  Pulse volume recordings (PVR) and segmental limb pressures suggest mild inflow aorto-iliac/common femoral/profunda femoris/or proximal superficial femoral artery disease, and popliteal/tibial vessel disease at rest.  The toe/brachial index is .28 (taken from 2nd toe).IMPRESSION1. Severe peripheral arterial disease in the right leg.2. Disease is located in the aorto-iliac, femoral, popliteal and tibial/peroneal segments and the digits on the right side.3. Mild peripheral arterial disease in the left leg.4. Disease is located in the aorto-iliac, femoral, popliteal and tibial/peroneal segments and the digits on the left side.5. There has been a significant drop in the ankle/brachial index in the right leg since the last exam, from 0.69 to 0.34.

Assessment and Recommendations: 50 yo F diabetic with active smoking and peripheral vascular disease, now with wet gangrene of L great toe.
1)       Consented and added to schedule for L great toe amputation and R forefoot ulcer debridement.
2)       NPO past midnight
3)       Hold all oral hypoglycemics, start insulin sliding scale.
4)       Prevalon boots
5)       Bedrest
