Impression	

39m with poorly controlled DM, albuminuria who comes for further mgmt dm and with recently dx'd hcv.  Over 1/2 this 25 minute visit was spent discussing modes of transmission of hcv and counseling regarding likely etiology/plans for bs, as well as disc of DM mgmt.



Plan	

DM: a1c had come down from 11.8-->9.9, but up to 10.4 last check.  now bs much better on total lantus 60u daily, split bid.  cont current regimen, recheck a1c next visit.  gave # for pt to r/s f/u with optho, last visit spring 2093.  cont metformin.  had abnl findings w/photos taken on dil exam; was to have f/u 2/94 but didn't happen.   malb elevated 97 in 9/93; on acei.  taking asa qd.  had pneumovax 2090.  foot exam nl 12/93.



Albuminuria: cont acei.  last 97 9/93.  cr stable 1.2 12/93.  follow cr on metformin.



HCV: hiv was neg.  hbv immune.  hav immune.  he had a needle stick around june 2092 at work, wasn't tested at that time for hcv/hiv, but had f/u test (for hiv only apparently) w/dr. roberson, neg at that time.  discussed that hcv may well have been from needle stick.  ruq u/s was nl, hcv genotype 1a.  lfts have been consistently nl, last 6/94.  was to have liver bx w/dr. kruse in april, but never occurred.  i will contact dr. kruse to facilitate arrangement of bx.



Atypical nevus: dnka appt w/derm for eval in march.  will rerefer at future visit.  copays $35 for nonpcp visit - difficult for him.



Hyperlipidemia: has low hdl 33 in 6/94, reviewed today & rec'd exercise.  ldl 119 on pravastatin -- inc to 40 mg.  lfts nl 6/94.  recheck lipids/lfts on inc prava next visit.



HM: lipids as above.  had Td booster 2089.  re: tob cessation/cutting down - he remains precontemplative.  tried wellbutrin in past w/no effect.  gave him # for pharm to consider Rx assistance progs, as he has been interested in this, filled out some paperwork for cheaper meds in past.  also offered to switch back to nph for cost reasons today, but he declined.



rtc 2-3mos f/u dm, hcv,  check lipids/lfts, umalb
