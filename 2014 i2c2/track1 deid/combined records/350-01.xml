Imaging:
Head CT: (my read) No hemorrhage, mass effect, or hypodensity/loss of grey-white junction.  No acute intracranial process.

Head MRI/MRA: pending


Impression: 58 year-old RHF w/ cardiovascular risk factor including HTN/DM/HL/obesity who presents with acute onset of R hand/arm weakness followed by headache/mild nausea.  Exam with R pronator drift/orbiting/hand clumsiness with distal>proximal arm weakness.  Slow motor initiation is characteristic of corticospinal tract lesion.  She has no face or leg weakness.

Sparing of face/leg suggests small embolic stroke to the corona radiata in L hemisphere where the motor fiber from face/arm/leg regions are most separated.  However, small capsular stroke is still a possibility.

Patient is outside the time window for acute stroke intervention.

Recommendations:
-Head and neck MRI/MRA
-If MRI shows a stroke, she will likely need to be admitted to RHR Neurology service for stroke workup including TTE, Holter, lipid panel, ESR, homocysteine, lipo(a), PT/OT.
-Change from ASA to Aggrenox for stroke prevention.
-Continue statin.
-Hold off on her BP med for 24 hours, but likely OK to resume after 24 hours if the stroke size is small.
