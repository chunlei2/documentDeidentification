Full

Source: Patient, patient record



CC: dyspnea, hypoxia 



HPI: 

47 yo man with long-standing bronchiectasis requiring double lung transplant in 2073 who states that for approximately the last month he has felt occasionally dyspneic and &#8220;dizzy&#8221; (which he more specifically describes as a sensation of unsteadiness, not vertigo-like), along with several discrete episodes of nausea with vomiting (maybe three days in the last month, the last time yesterday). 
He was visiting friends/family near The Woodlands, when on 8/20 he awoke feeling acutely dyspneic and weak.



He presented to Marion Memorial Hospital, where he was noted to be saturating in the high 90s on 2L, which is his baseline (4L with activity). Other notable labs were a Cr of 2.3, BNP 84, INR subtherapeutic at 1.4. CXR was read as no acute processHe was thought to be wheezy, and was given 10 mg of dexamethasone IV, nebulizers. He was empirically started on a heparin drip (800 unit bolus, 1800 units/hr) given his h/o DVT and a subtherapeutic INR. He was then transferred to MARY. 



In the ED here his INR was 2.4 (and his PTT was over 150). Upon interview here, he endorses the above history. Vitals upon arrival to the ED 97.3 79 141/95 24 100%2L.



He also notes that his INR had been stable recently (followed by his PCP) on his current dose of 4 Coumadin daily (except 2 on Mon/Fri). 



He denies cough, chest pain, GI symptoms, URI symptoms



15-point ROS negative except as in HPI with following additions: none.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



47-year-old man with h/o double lung transplant admitted with one-month h/o subjective dyspnea (without hypoxia), weakness, and intermittent nausea. Workup relatively unremarkable so far. History not c/w PE, lungs clear on admission exam, no fever or leukocytosis or cough endorsed. 



Dyspnea/nausea/weakness: 

-check orthostatics

-continue heparin drip at reduced rate (units/hr), recheck INR this am, continue coumadin at home dose, lower extremity ultrasound to eval for DVT (as possible proxy for PE)

-continue rglan per home regimen

-transplant service to follow

-lung exam currently clear, little suspicion for COPD flare &#8211; will resume steroids at home dose (12.5 mg)

-schedule duonebs



s/p lung transplant: missed last night&#8217;s doses of mycophenolate and tacro, got them at 4 am today in ED

-discussed with pulm &#8211; hold am dose of mycophenolate/tacro today, restart this evening

-continue prophylactic meds/abx: colistin, azithro, bactrim, doxy



Renal insufficiency: at baseline. Seems relatively euvolemic

-will continue colchicine for gout proph as this has been long-standing

-lasix still on hold

-BNP was low at OSH; don&#8217;t suspect volume overload



Chronic hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia:

-continue mag gluconate, substitute calcium carbonate for calcium citrate



FEN: 

-follow lytes

-no MIVF

-regular diet 





PPX:

-GI: ranitidine per home regimen       

-DVT: on heparin drip/coumadin          





Code Status:        FULL (presumed)
