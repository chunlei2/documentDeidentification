RE:  Peter Joshi

MRN: 453-39-84-4

 

Dear Dr. Craft:

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Clinic today.  This lovely gentleman continues to see

both me and Dr. Orlena Knowles.  I have discussed this with Dr.

Knowles and I am certainly comfortable in whatever role you all

would need to see me playing in Mr. Joshi's care.  He notes that

his weight has increased to 212 lb and that he has been followed

closely by Dr. Knowles who is adjusting Lasix and potassium

chloride doses.  He has had no shortness of breath at rest.  He

has noticed no significant change in his lower extremity edema. 

He has mild orthopnea and no paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea.  His

medical regimen includes aspirin 325 mg PO q.d., Lasix 80 mg PO

b.i.d., Isordil 40 mg PO b.i.d., Zestril 40 mg PO b.i.d.,

Lopressor 100 mg PO b.i.d., simvastatin 20 mg PO q.d., Norvasc 5

mg PO b.i.d., Prevacid 20 mg PO q.d., and K-Dur 25 mEq q.d. in

addition to albuterol, Atrovent, and Serevent.

 

His physical exam is notable for a blood pressure of 150/70 right

and left arm seated.  After rest, this comes down to 135/70 right

and left arm seated.  His heart rate is 70 and regular. 

Respiratory rate is 10.  His room air saturation is 95%.  His

lungs are clear to auscultation, although breath sounds are

somewhat distant.  Cardiovascular exam is notable for

nondisplaced PMI and a soft systolic ejection murmur.  His

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Extremities are notable for edema

to his knees bilaterally.

Electrocardiogram is notable for sinus rhythm with an axis of -14

and normal intervals, no evidence of ischemia or infarction.  No

change from prior electrocardiograms.

 

In summary, Mr. Joshi is currently being treated for ongoing

congestive heart failure.  His pulmonary evaluation here was

notable for a combination of restrictive and obstructive

pulmonary dysfunction.  I would certainly concur with continued

diuresis with close attention to his potassium, BUN, and

creatinine.

 

If there are any questions or issues, please give me a call.

 

Sincerely,

 

 

Corrine James-Wagner, M.D.
