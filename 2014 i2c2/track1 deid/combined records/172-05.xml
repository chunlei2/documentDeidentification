FREEPORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   Ms Rivers was hospitalized 1/22-1/24/67 after presenting to ER with left shoulder pain that evolved to an ache radiating to her chest and forearm, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness.  In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.
