FOR DETAILS, PLEASE SEE AALIYAH IRAHETA'S NOTE



ID/CC: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who presents w/ RLE weakness/decreased sensation x 24hrs



HPI: 49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, Afib, DM, Bipolar, who was in USOH until 10d ago, when had weakness in his L arm.  Thought this was 2/2 sleeping on it.  Involved whole arm from shoulder down.  Was still doing his ADL's but felt like the arm was slightly weaker, took 4-5 days to get back to normal.  



Then, 12/12/11, was eating dinner w/ a friend, got up to go to BR, found he had RLE weakness/stiffness.  Noticed it was hard to climb stairs.  Went to sleep    woke up at 2am    nearly fell 2/2 weakness in his leg.  In addition, has sensory loss in RLE, esp foot - felt    cold and dead.     The sensory loss was worst distally, but extended up to his thigh.  Never had trouble speaking or understanding others, did not have a facial droop, no problems w/ his RUE.  Stayed in bed until am, when he called his PCP, who told him to come to ED.  



Of note, in Oct-Nov 2111, had cardiac cath x 2.  Had NSTEMI on Oct 8, 2111    taken to cardiac cath    cath showed significant RCA disease and 40% prox LCx    c/b Vfib needing defib    stent placed for stenotic RCA lesion, c/b dissection needing 2nd stent placed.  Post cath had Afib requiring amiodarone.  Then had subsequent cath Nov 1 after an episode of CP, stents patent, other vessels stable.  After his inpt cardiac hospitalization, was admitted to psych for 1 wk for suicidality/depression.  



Previously, in spring 2110, had L eye visual disturbance    nearly blind    went to GHIC where was dx'ed w/ retinal venous occlusion, treated w/ cortisone and laser surgery, w/ mild improvement in vision (now blurred in that eye).



No HA, no tinnitus, no vertigo.  No blurry vision except in L eye from venous occlusion, no diplopia.  No problems w/ speech.

MRI brain: Acute/subacute infarcts (DWI bright/ADC dark/FLAIR bright) in L cerebellum (punctate) and R precentral gyrus (small elliptical area).  



CT-A head/neck: has aberrant origin of R vert from CCA, both ACA's come off of L carotid, also w/ bilateral fetal PCA's and likely congenitally small vertebrobasilar vessels.  No significant focal stenoses or atheromatous calcifications.  



EKG: pending



MRI L/S spine: negative



IMPRESSION:

49yoRHM w/ PMH signif for CAD, DM, Bipolar disorder, afib, s/p recent cardiac cath who presents w/ LUE weakness 10d prior to admission resolving after 4-5 days, and RLE weakness?/sensory deficit? Imaging reveals R precentral gyrus small infarct, L cerebellar infarct, no significant vessel stenoses.  Neuro exam w/ brisker reflexes on R, equivocal RLE weakness, R sensory sx, ? R upgoing toe.  Clinical picture and imaging are not consistent.  Unclear if pt is a poor historian and current sx are non-objective sensory findings and meaningful event was LUE weakness 4-5d ago.

NEURO: stroke w/u including TTE/Holter, lipids/lipoprotein/homocysteine.  

--Will also send hypercoag w/u (including hypercoag panel, PT20210, Factor V Leiden, APLA, lupus anticoagulant) given hx of retinal venous thrombus and young age.

--Will also send BCx2 given recent cardiac cath, although ESR wnl reassuring re ? of endocarditis.

--Will check A1c re ? of adequate DM control.

--Given psych hx, will check tox screen and LFT's.

--Unclear if afib was only in context of post-cath, post Vfib.  Will look for LAE, holter abnl.  Could make a case to anti-coagulate regardless as has had documented afib.  

CV: hold anti-htn meds now.  Continue lipitor at outpt dose.  Allow SBP up to 180.

PSYCH: continue w/ depakote and lithium.  Mood is ok now, but will need to be monitored.

FEN: no IVF, ada 1800 low chol/low fat diet.  

ENDO: NPH 20 bid for now, titrate up as needed, RISS.  Checking A1c.

PPX: put on sc fragmin, nexium.  Pneumoboots.
