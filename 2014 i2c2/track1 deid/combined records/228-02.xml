Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Wonda Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up status
post coronary artery bypass surgery and pounding headaches.  As you
know, we performed a persantine MIBI recently which showed inferior
wall ischemia.  I wasn't sure whether or not this ischemia was new. 
On review of her coronary artery bypass surgery notes, she did not
have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,
I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is
probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not
bypass this area.  She did have a LIMA to the LAD and two saphenous
venous grafts to the circumflex territory, the OM and the diagonal. 
She has been doing relatively well with chest discomfort and I
recommended we continue her current cardiac medications.  However,
she has been complaining of pounding headaches and she did have a
history of otitis media in her right ear.  Therefore, I think it
wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate
her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the
meantime, I have suggested that she take her nifedipine and
nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during
these episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during
these episodes is due more to anxiety than to intrinsic problem
with her cardiovascular system.  She will return to see me in
follow-up in three months time, at which time I will check her
cholesterol level.
 
Again, thank you for allowing me to participate in the care of your
patient.  Please do not hesitate to call me if you have any
questions.
 
With warm regards,
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.
