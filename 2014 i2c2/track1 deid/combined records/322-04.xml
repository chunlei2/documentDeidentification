MANAMANA  MEDICAL  CONSULT  NOTE
PATIENT:  Vaughn, Frank R.
MANAMANA MR#:  6767510
PCP:  Henry Jenkins, M.D. (503 155-7742)
PSYCH:  Brittany Prince, M.D.
CONTACT:  Mother, Haley Vaughn (158 857-4114)
SOURCE:   Patient; M.D. Passoff; Previous Medical Records
PRECAUTIONS:   MRSA; VRE
PRIMARY SERVICE:  Psychiatry Service (Internal Medicine)
CONSULT DATE:   6/19/77
TIME:   2:00 PM
CC:  Suicidal ideation
REASON for CONSULT:  Evaluation for history of medical problems


HPI:  Pt is a 33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation.  Dr. Prince had arranged involuntary hospitalization for this pt with campus security and EMS, prior to his arrival for the appointment.  However, per Mr. Vaughn, he arrived to the appointment only with the expectation of discussing his depression and refilling his Celexa, which he has been unable to take for the past 2 weeks, due to an expired prescription.  Dr. Prince documents a discussion in which the pt was tearful and emotional, while describing active suicidal ideation with a plan to overdose on oxycodone.  He reportedly had several episodes this past week, where he had more than a hundred oxycodone pills in his hand, but did not follow through on his plans.  Given concern for imminent danger, a Section 12 was completed, and pt was transferred to the MANAMANA ED.  


The pt does admit to phobias of the hospital, and strong desire to avoid admission.  However, he states that his last suicidal ideation was approximately 2 weeks ago, and that he changed his mind, once he realized his mother&#8217;s soon-to-be ex-husband, who has been threatening her, will be released from prison soon.  Moreover, he states that he has been taking all his medications, checking his insulin at least four times a day for his sliding scale, and changing the dressings on his sacral and scrotal wounds, with intent to improving his health.


The Medical Service was asked to evaluate the pt for active and impending medical issues prior to admission to a Psychiatry Service.

ASSESSMENT
33 y.o. male with HTN, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, recent prolonged hospitalization for Fournier&#8217;s gangrene at MANAMANA, and depression, who was transferred to the MANAMANA Psychiatry by his MEDIQUIK psychiatrist, Dr. Prince from her clinic today for active suicidal ideation, who now denies suicidal ideation, but being evaluated by the medical service for active medical issues.  Pt does have hypertension, IDDM2, hyperlipidemia, and open wounds near his scrotum and sacrum.  All of these medical issues appear to be stable, although their management could be fine-tuned via an outpatient basis.  Hypertension is being managed appropriately with a betablocker (HCTZ caused hyponatremia), but given his history of microalbuminuria, he should also be on an ACE-I or ARB.  His history of hypertriglyceridemia was persistent, even in the setting of insulin for DM2 and improved glycemic control.  He would also benefit from restarting a fibrate, such as Lopid.  His DM2 is quite stable, as pt reports FS of 100 to 200 at home with his current insulin regimen.  The wounds should be evaluated by his Surgical Team through his outpatient appointments.  His last evaluation by General Surgery just 2 days ago showed significant improvement, with recommendations of BID dressing changes as the pt is currently doing.
RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Continue Toprol XL 100mg PO once daily
