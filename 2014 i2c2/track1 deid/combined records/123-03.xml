64 yo for f/u of chest pain



1. chest pain- this occurs usually upon waking, in upper ant. chest, sometimes radiates to both shoulders. Describes it as "pressure". Not affected by NTG SL but is relieved within 30 minutes of taking omeprazole. Had adenosine stress test yesterday showing:

 

mild LV dilatation following stress, resolves on rest images

perfusion images show moderate anteroseptal and apical ischemia



2. + H. Pylori- completed treatment since last visit and no further "heartburn"-burning sensation .



3. R hip pain-DJD. Has appt to see Dr. Becker in consultation. Will need  cardiology clearance prior to any ortho surgery given yesterday's ETT.



4. DM- does not take glyburide daily. If she does not eat any "carbs" she doesn't take it. Last HgA1C 8.2. She is sure she is losing wgt since her clothes feel big but her wgt is unchanged from August
