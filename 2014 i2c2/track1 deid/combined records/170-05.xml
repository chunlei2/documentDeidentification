AbdCTw&amp;w/oConPelCTw&amp;w/oContrst 18-Jun-2150 

REPORT:

     TECHNIQUE:

     CT of the abdomen and pelvis WITH AND WITHOUT intravenous

     contrast.

     

     Scans were continued into the pelvis to evaluate the ureters.

     

     COMPARISON: CT chest dated 7/8/49, CT scan dated 1/10/49

     

     FINDINGS:

     LOWER THORAX: There is a 4 mm subpleural nodule involving the

     lateral segment right middle lobe (series 4, image 3), stable.

     There is a 7-mm nodule involving the periphery of the left lower

     lobe (series 4, image 23), stable.  There is a 6-mm subpleural

     nodule involving the posterior basal segment right lower lobe

     (series 4 and image 49), new from the prior study, but which may

     represent atelectatic changes.  Mild bibasilar dependent changes.

     

     HEPATOBILIARY: The liver demonstrates mildly cirrhotic morphology.

     No focal hepatic lesions.  No biliary ductal dilatation.

     SPLEEN: Mild splenomegaly at 14.6 cm.

     PANCREAS: No focal masses or ductal dilatation.

     

     ADRENALS: No adrenal nodules.

     KIDNEYS/URETERS: No hydronephrosis.  There is a punctate

     nonobstructing intrarenal calculus involving the lower pole of the

     left kidney. There is a 10 x 5 mm ovoid calcification in the

     region of the left distal ureter at the ureterovesicular junction,

     stable since 1/10/49, and consistent with a nonobstructing distal

     ureteral calculus.

     

     There is a 6 mm hypodensity involving the interpolar region of the

     left kidney which is too small characterize.  There is a

     subcentimeter hyperdense focus involving the lower pole the right

     kidney of apparent (series 2, image 32), stable and possibly

     representing a proteinaceous/hemorrhagic cyst.  There is cortical

     scarring involving the upper pole of left kidney and lower pole

     right kidney.

     PELVIC ORGANS/BLADDER: The prostate gland is enlarged.

     

     PERITONEUM / RETROPERITONEUM: No free air or fluid.

     LYMPH NODES: No lymphadenopathy.

     VESSELS: There is mild atherosclerotic calcification involving the

     aorta and its branches.

     

     GI TRACT: No distention or wall thickening.  Scattered sigmoid

     diverticula without evidence of diverticulitis.

     

     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES: There are degenerative changes involving

     the visualized spine.  There are no suspicious lytic or blastic

     lesions.

     

     IMPRESSION:

     Nonobstructing 10 mm distal left ureteral calculus at the

     ureterovesicular junction, unchanged since 1/10/49.  Punctate

     nonobstructing intrarenal calculus involving the lower pole the

     left kidney.

     

     Bilateral pulmonary nodules measuring up to 7 mm, including a 6 mm

     right lower lobe nodule new from the prior study, but which may

     represent atelectatic changes.  A follow-up CT scan chest is

     recommended in 3 months.

     




Impression:   69 yo male s/p cystoscopy, laser lithotripsy, stone removal, and stents with post-op urinary retention.
