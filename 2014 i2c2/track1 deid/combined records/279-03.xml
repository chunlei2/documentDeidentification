Team X Intern Admission Note



Name:	Hendrickson, Ora

MR# 		7194334

Date:  	01/13/93

PCP:		Oliveira, Keith MD



CC/RFA:  SOB.



HPI: Pt is a 76 yo F with a h/o CAD, HTN, hypercholesterolemia, COPD, CHF who developed acute SOB while at home PM of admission. Pt reports no dietary discretions and excellent adherence to medications. She was out evening of admission at a social gathering and noticed symptoms when she returned home and had difficulty climbing an internal staircase in her home She ascended the staircase and was unable to regain her breath. She reports she developed profound dyspnea and tachycardia. She denies chest pain, diaphoresis, dizziness or LOC. She has had a cough productive of clear sputum x 1 week with no fever, night sweats, rigors or chills during this time. She has had no vomiting or diarrhea. She does not recall wheezing, and asserts the only symptoms during the episode consisted in SOB and tachypnea.



Of note, pt had 2 vessel CABG in 11/92. Catheterization on 11/18/92 revealed 100% obstruction of the left proximal circ, 70% proximal LAD obstruction, and 100% obstruction of the mid RCA. 



Course in ED:

En route to BBH pt received Lasix 40 mg, TNG x 3. She was described as pale, cool, and diaphoretic. She was unable to complete full sentences. She received Lasix 40 mg IV and 20 mg IV 2 hours later, ASA 325 x 1, Zofran 8 mg IV, and 0.5     nitropaste. Initial vitals were T 98 P 93 BP 148/67  RR 24  93 % on 6 L and 100% on BiPap (brief).

Wall Motion Abbreviations: N=Normal H=Hypokinetic A=Akinetic D=Dyskinetic



MITRAL VALVE

There is calcification of the posterior mitral annulus.  There is no evidence

of mitral valve prolapse.  There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and

spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

The left atrium is dilated.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is thickening of the bases of multiple aortic leaflets.  The aortic

valve is tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or

spectral Doppler.  There are irregular echoes along the aortic wall c/w

atheroma.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There

is segmental left ventricular dysfunction (see wall motion plot).  This

involves the lateral,inferior and apical territory.  There is a false tendon

within the LV cavity which is a normal variant.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 33 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A.

There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral

Doppler.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricular systolic function

is within normal limits.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is a small circumferential pericardial effusion.  There is increased

intrapericardial pressure without evidence of frank tamponade.  There is

diffuse fibrin deposition on the visceral pericardium.  There is evidence of a

pleural effusion.



CONCLUSIONS

Compared to the report of 6/5/2089,the left ventricular systolic function is

impaired with new wall motion abnormalities. Also a new pericardial effusion

is visualized.



EKG: 

NSR, 90 bpm. ST elevations V1-V6.

_______________________________________

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:



76 yo F with PVD, CAD, s/p CABG, CHF, with acute onset SOB, likely CHF exacerbation.



CV:

Pt has diffuse CAD with propensity for failure, most likely etiology for SOB being CHF.

  	Pump 33%. Continue beta blocker, CCB. 

Daily weights, Is and Os, diurese with goal of -0.5 liters QD.

PT/OT for chronic deconditioning 2/2 failure.

  	Ischemia. H/o CABG, PVD. Cont ASA, statin. 

Cycle enzymes.

Serial EKGs.

AdenoMIBI to identify ischemia, assess CABG grafts, risk for failure.

  	Rhythm: sinus. 

Place pt on monitor given hx.



DM:

Sliding scale insulin.



HTN:

Beta blockade.



Anxiety:

Uses Klonopin 0.5 mg BID.



 GERD:

Prilosec.



FEN:

Cardiac diet; follow electrolytes given active diuresis.
