NAME:     Oliver, Uriah 
MRN:       7916007

Primary Care Provider:  Dr. Patterson

Mr. Oliver returns for follow-up of several issues.

Weight 175.  Blood pressure 130/80. 

MEDICATIONS:   He finished Flagyl last night, and he took his last dose of levoflox
today.  Glyburide is on hold.  He is taking hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg q.d., Lovastatin
20 mg q.d., fosinopril 40 mg q.d., verapamil SR 240 mg q.d., ASA 1 q.d., metoprolol
75 mg three times a day and Glucophage 1000 mg b.i.d.  

(1)  Diverticulitis and history of colon cancer.  

     S:   His pain is gone although he continues to have a bad taste in his mouth
          since he has been on antibiotics. 

     O:   His abdomen is soft with normal bowel sounds.  There is no tenderness
          today.  

     P:   He will need colonoscopy at the Atlantic North in a month or so. 

(2)  Diarrhea.  

     S:   He has continued to have several soft, dark bowel movements a day
          while he has been taking the antibiotic.  He has not seen any bright red
          blood per rectum.  He has been using Equal and eating ice cream.  

     O:   Stool for C. diff. and stool C&S were both negative. 

     P:   I asked him to discontinue artificial sweeteners and milk products,
          except for yogurt, for 3 days.  He will call if the diarrhea persists off the
          antibiotic.  

(3)  Guaiac-positive stool on examination last week.  

     O:   His hematocrit had increased to 35.7 last week.  

     P:   Recheck CBC.  He will bring me the name of his GI physician at the
          Atlantic North so that I can communicate with him about the recent events
          and arrange for follow-up colonoscopy.  

(4)  Dizziness.  

     S:   This has resolved. 

(5)  Diabetes. 

     S:   He stopped glyburide as directed last week when his 4 p.m. blood sugar
          was 44.  His fingerstick blood sugar was 192 this morning.  He reports
          that he is eating much better.  

     P:   He will restart glyburide 5 mg q.d. when his blood sugar is greater than
          200.

(6)  Systolic murmur and right bundle branch block.

     P:   His echocardiogram has been requested but he has not yet received the
          appointment.  

(7)  Coronary artery disease.  

     S:   He has had no chest pain.  He apparently had an appointment last week
          for an exercise tolerance test at the Atlantic North but the technician was
          not there.  He has another appointment later this week with the doctor
          at the Atlantic North.

     P:   I gave him a copy of the final NYSH discharge summary from his recent
          hospitalization as well as copies of the EKGs done during the
          hospitalization and a copy of the abdominal CT report to take to his
          doctor at the Atlantic North.

(8)  Proteinuria during the hospitalization. 

     O:   His serum creatinine was 1.5 (likely elevated given his age).  Repeat
          urinalysis showed 1+ albumin with no other significant abnormalities. 

     P:   Check 24-hour urine for protein and creatinine.  Check serum protein
          electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis. 

(9)  Chronic anemia.  

     O:   He had normal iron studies, B12 and folate several months ago.  His
          hematocrit was stable as of last week.  

     P:   Check serum protein electrophoresis and urine immunoelectrophoresis.  

(10) Decreased HDL.  

     A:   We could either add niacin or change his statin from Mevacor to Lipitor
          to increase the HDL.  

     P:   I have deferred this issue to his primary care physician. 

He will return for follow-up in 2 weeks so that we can make final arrangements for
the colonoscopy and to check progress with his diabetes.
