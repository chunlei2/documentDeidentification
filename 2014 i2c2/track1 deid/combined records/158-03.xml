CODE STATUS:  FULL CODE

SDU ADMIT DATE:  01/17/05

REASON FOR SDU ADMIT:  NSTEMI;  Awaiting cardiac catheterization

CC:  55 y.o. male w/ DM type 2, hyperlipidemia, positive family history for CAD, and hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who p/w NSTEMI



HPI:  

Mr. Fredrick is a pleasant 55 y.o. male with cardiac risk factors of recently diagnosed DM Type 2 (NIDDM), hyperlipidemia, and extensive family history, as well as, hx of XRT to chest for Hodgkin's lymphoma, who presents with chest pain, and found to have NSTEMI at Modesto State Hospital (MSH), transferred to SSH for cardiac catheterization.  Patient woke up on 1/16/05 with intermittent, stuttering "pressure-like" substernal chest pain, rating 7 out of 10, lasting from 15 minutes to 45 minutes.  He is very active with walking exercises, and gardening, and had not experienced this type of pain before.  The pain radiated down the left arm, his left jaw, and shoulder, as well as, causing "throat tightness".  He denied associated SOB, DOE, diaphoresis, palpitations, fevers, chills, N/V/D, or any other constitutional symptoms.  He took an ASA 81mg PO x1, called his PCP, and presented to MSH.



In the MSH ED, his vitals were as follows:

T: AF   HR: 109   BP: 169/81   FS: 248

EKG demonstrated sinus tachycardia at 104bpm with ST depressions in V3-V5.  He received morphine 2 mg IV, ASA 325 mg, SL TNG x 2, Lopressor IV 5 mg x 3.  The chest pain resolved, and the pt has been chest pain free since.  6 hours after presentation he had 7 beat run of VT. He has not had anymore chest pain since the ER but did have palpitations with VT run. He feels his heart being 'irregular' at times.  He was started on IV heparin and an IV 2b/3a inhibitor, and transferred to SSH on 1/17/05 for cardiac catheterization. 



PMH/PSH

1. DM Type 2: Metformin started 2 weeks ago.  Hgb A1C of 10.2.

2. Hodgkins Lymphoma:  Dx'ed in 2084 s/p XRT and chemotherapy with lymph node removal. Recurrence in 2085 with chemo treatment.  S/p chest surgery in 2085 to see extent of recurrence.

3. Lung cancer:  S/p right middle lobe resection for adenocarcinoma in 2096

4. DVT:  Hx of DVT in right knee.  On coumadin x 1.5 months, this happened while on chemotherapy. Coumadin stopped b/c of hematuria. 

5. Migraine headaches: Hx in 2070's to early 80's.  Now resolved. 

6. GERD: On Zantac PRN

7. S/p Appendectomy with peritonitis

ASSESSMENT/PLAN

55 y.o. male w/ NIDDM, hyperlipidemia, POS family hx, and XRT to chest for Hodgkin's Lymphoma (2086), who p/w an episode of NSVT and NSTEMI, transferred from MSH for cardiac catheterization.  He is currently on ASA, Heparin IV, and Integrilin.  His CK-MB has already peaked, and remains hemodynamically stable.



1. ISCHEMIA: Troponin I elev and CK-MB peaked at 21.  He has already peaked his CK-MB, and appears stable.  On ASA, Lopressor, and Lipitor.  Will give Lipitor 40mg PO QD, and not 80mg PO QD, due to mild transaminitis.

- Continue Heparin IV and Integrilin IV.  

- Holding Plavix given risk of 3 vessel disease, and need for CABG

- Pt has tolerated IV contrast in the past, so will plan for cardiac cath on 01/18/05 per Dr. Orosco

- NPO after midnight tonight



2. PUMP: 

- On Lopressor

- Will add ACE-I or ARB after cath



3. HYPERLIPIDEMIA: 

- Continue Lipitor 40mg QD



4. DM2: 

- On RISS

- On Cardiac and diabetic diet

- Nutrition Consult for cardiac and diabetic diet teaching



5. LFT ELEV: Trend LFTs



6. PROPHY: Nexium, Heparin IV



7. DISPO: Pending cardiac cath results
