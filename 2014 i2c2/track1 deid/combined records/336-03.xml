Diabetes Management Consult 






CC    

Asked by Dr Vines to see the patient for assistance with management of diabetes mellitus.
 She is intubated so details of medical history not available other than what I can get from medical records and her daughters who are with her.



HPI   

72year old female patient with a history of diabetes diagnosed &gt;20 years ago.  Patient is treated with diet and oral hypoglycemic agents at home. Prior to admission patient was taking metformin 500 mg qday.  Patient tests blood glucose at home but results unknown. Patient has had/not had recent episodes of hypoglycemia. Pt has known retinopathy, nephropathy or neuropathy.



Hospital course since admission:
 Pt has a history of COPD/interstitial lung disease with biopsy confirming BOOP on home O2 last 2 weeks and prednisone since 12/79, OA s/p bilateral knee replacements, chronic venous stasis, and s/p biological AVR 11/78 presents with several month h/o SOB. She states increasing SOB since 9/79 and now has difficulty with any activity. She had chest pain this previous week at her rehabilitation facility/nursing home and was evaluated at OSH. She was found to have anemia with hct 25 and increased troponin to 1.5. Pt was found to be CHF and is being treated with IV lasix. Was diagnosed with SBE with BC positive for enterococci and gemella morbillorum. Was initially on Vancomycin then later switched to Ampicillin and gentamycin for 6 weeks course(till May 11) as per ID recs. GI was consulted for guaiac positive stool and Hct drop. But over the course of hospital stay her Hct was stable and stool guaiac negative so GI deferred scoping her till her is clear of infection. Pt was also found to have RLL PE and is on Lovenox.LENIS Bilateral LE negative. Thyroid nodule with FNA negative. Plan was to transfer her to rehab and schedule her for AVR when she is clear of infection. But unfortunately she went into resp distress this AM 04/12/80 and got intubated.

Assessment 

Type 2 DM &#8211; Uncontrolled in the setting of surgery/ stress/ steroids. Outpatient diabetes control appeared to be  adequate on metformin with an A1c of 5.6. Her creat was somewhat elevated post op although in better range when coming into the hospital so whether it is appropriate to resume metformin when ready to go home will need to be evaluated.
