SUBJECTIVE:  The patient comes in stating that she has had 5
days of substernal pain like a "ball pressing in on her
chest."  She has also had abdominal pain and has felt quite
poorly.  She did call this service this past weekend she
states and never received a call back.  She called me this
morning, and I saw her immediately.  The pain has not gone
down her arms and it is mostly located in her chest.  She
feels occasionally like she is going to throw up, and she
says that her blood sugars have been quite high.  She does
have diabetes.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her lungs are clear to P&A.  Her
blood pressure is 130/80 in the right arm sitting with a
pulse of 64.  Her neck veins are flat, carotids 2+ and equal
without bruit.  Heart is not enlarged.  There is a regular
sinus rhythm, and no significant murmurs.  Liver and spleen
are not felt.  EKG taken shows a possible old anterior
myocardial infarction, which is a distinct change from her
last EKG with poor progression of the R waves across the
precordium.

IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  Question myocardial infarction. 
Because of her prolonged pain and changes in the EKG, I
think that she should be observed in the BH emergency
ward and attend her there.
