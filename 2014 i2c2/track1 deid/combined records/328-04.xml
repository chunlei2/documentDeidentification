Deformity of the odontoid process, consistent with old odontoid process fracture. Multilevel degenerative changes as described above. Indeterminate 5 mm nodule noted in the right lung apex, stable from the prior study dated 11/13/2077.6/14/78: CT head No acute intracranial abnormality identified. Nonspecific white matter changes, most likely representing chronic small vessel change in this age group.6/14/78: Cspine XR: No evidence of displaced fracture or malalignment.6/14/78: LS spine XR: No displaced lumbar spine fracture.6/14/78: ankle XR: 1. Posterior talus fracture. 2. Possible fractures of the posterior malleolus, distal fibula. 3. Subtalar subluxation. 4. Given the severe osteopenia, suggest CT scan for more definitive evaluation.6/14/78: CXR:   No evidence of traumatic injury in the chest6/14/78: hip/pelvis XR:  1.  Acute, comminuted right intertrochanteric hip fracture. 2.  Left hip hardware, appears intact. 3.  Healed pubic ramus fractures.6/14/78: ankle CT: No evidence of talar fracture or any other acute displaced fracture. There is patchy osteopenia.&#8226; EKG: 6/14/78 at 10:25AM: sinus ~@71, left axis, no ST changes.6/14/78 at 4:14PM: AF with RVR ~ 141 still no ischemic ST changes.ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN88F with dementia, HTN, hx multiple falls, s/p hip fx 2077, hx likely NMS in setting of haldol, p/w another fall, likely mechanical, and hip fx. We are asked to consult for periop risk eval prior to ORIF.1. Periop cardiac risk: Pt&#8217;s RCRI is zero, and has no Hx CAD. Now, as she as in RVR to 140s, she has no ST depressions. Pt does not need periop beta blockade from a risk perspective, but should continue on home beta blockade given her HTN and now new AF.2. new AF: pt is now in new AF/RVR, asymptomatic, after missing her AM atenolol. She is getting 5mg IV lopressor plus 25 mg po lopressor in the ED, hopefully this will provide some rate control. She should continue on BB.- try 37.5 mg lopressor q8h; hold for HR &lt;60, SBP &lt;100- it is possible that arrhythmia may precipitate falls. She may benefit from a holter monitor as an outpatient, to see whether she is frequently in AF, or whether this was precipitated by illness and missing BB (more likely).- keep pt on tele while in house3. Hx NMS/serotonin syndrome: pt carries a dx of NMS from prior med use the last time she was hospitalized for hip surgery (see CAS notes 11/16/77). However, pt is elderly and with hx of dementia, is at risk for postop dementia. Given this, avoid anti-dopaminergic meds like haldol, seroquel, zydis/zyprexa, reglan. This pt tolerates small doses of benzo as a home med, therefore pt can try:- home klonopin 0.25mg po bid standing- ativan 0.5 mg q6h prn agitation- monitor for signs of NMS: mental status changes with muscle rigidity, fever, autonomic instability. Check CK if this happens and page med consult 06885 if any concerns.Thank you for this consult. We will follow with you.__________________________________Peggy Ellis, PGY-2 Pager #75412
