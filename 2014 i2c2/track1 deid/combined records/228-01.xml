RE:  Wonda Benitez
     MR #892-76-95-4
 
Dear Usha:
 
I had the pleasure of seeing one of your clinic patients, Ms.
Benitez, in my cardiovascular clinic for follow-up for palpitations,
hypertension, and status post coronary artery bypass surgery.  As
you know, she has been complaining of leg cramps mostly at night. 
She has been taking quinine for this, however develops palpitations
whenever she takes the quinine.  She has not been taking this since
the initial two doses.  I suspect that her leg cramps are probably
secondary to intermittent passing fluxes.  I have told her to eat
a banana during the evening and possibly this would avoid leg
cramps in the evening.  In the meantime, her EKG showed sinus
bradycardia at a rate of 50 per minute.  There is borderline first
degree AV block and anterolateral infarct by EKG which is unchanged
from previous tracing.  We will continue her on Vasotec 10 mg bid
as well as Lopressor 12.5 mg bid.  She will see me in follow-up in
three months' time.
 
Again, thank you for referring this patient to my cardiovascular
clinic.
 
With warm regards.
 
Sincerely,
 
 
 
Gordon Q. Iniguez, M.D.
