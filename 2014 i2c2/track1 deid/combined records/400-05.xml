ATTENDING PHYSICIAN:  Gregory Rosas, MD


CHIEF COMPLAINT

Hyponatremia



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo woman with a hx of schizophrenia, DM2, HTN, HL presenting with confusion and hyponatremia.  Patient states over the past 2 days she has felt confused and weak, citing that when someone would call she was unable to speak.  She also has felt unsteady on her feet and fell twice yesterday when out walking, hitting her face and arm.  She reports dizziness prior to fall but denies chest pain, palpitations or SOB.  There was no loss of consciousness and she was able to get up/ambulate after fall.  Of note, she has switched from drinking 7 cans of diet coke per day to 7 cans of regular coke because the facility where she lives ran out of diet coke.  She is also restricting her caloric intake and her meals consist of a croissant at breakfast, cottage cheese at lunch and an avocado for dinner, in attempt to lose weight.   She has not had any recent medication changes.  She denies recent fever, chills, CP, headache, abdominal pain, diarrhea, dysuria.  She does report significant thirst and frequent urination.  She also reports SOB with exertion, particularly walking up stairs.    

  

In the ED initial VS were T 99.2  HR 98  BP 173/93  RR 22.  Labs were significant for a Na 118, K 3.5, Cl 82, CO2 17.5, AG 19, WBC 15, Hct 32.  CXR was clear.  She was given a total of 1L NS and free water restricted.  She was admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

EKG &#8211; Sinus tachycardia.  Rate 106.  Q waves in II, III, aVF, V3.  Slightly changed from prior.



                

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Ms. Ostrander is a 64 yo Peruvian woman with schizophrenia, HTN, DM2, HL presenting with confusion and found to have significant metabolic disarray including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, hypochloremia and an anion gap.  She also has a mild leukocytosis, anemia &#8211; at baseline, and thrombocytosis.  



##: Hyponatremia &#8211; Calculated serum osmolality is 248 mOsm/L (measured 241) suggesting a hypotonic hyponatremia.  Clinically she appears euvolemic, despite having a dry mouth which may be from patient&#8217;s antipsychotics.   A Uosm of 62 is most suggestive of primary polydipsia vs. low solute.  Patient is drinking 2L coke/day and complaining of excessive thirst, per PCP/psych notes she is told to limit fluids to 1L.  Interestingly this may have been precipitated by switching from diet coke to coke as diet coke contains 30mg Na and 0gm carbs while regular coke contains 45mg Na and 39gm carbohydrates.  Increased carbohydrates with little sodium, protein or potassium load (such as in beer potomania) can inhibit protein breakdown and urea excretion, therefore decreasing daily solute excretion to &lt;250mOsm, which can result in hypoNa if fluid intake is increased.


Correct at a rate of &lt;0.5mEq/L/h since she is no longer symptomatic

Q6H lytes to ensure correct rate of correction &#8211; prevent osmotic demyelination

Fluid restrict to 1L fluid/day

Since she is euvolemic, no indication for NS repletion

Patient refused nutrition consult to discuss dietary choices &#8211; clearly she is making poor dietary choices and her caloric intake is ~800-1000 kcal/day currently from food (+~1000kcal from soda)



##: Protected fall &#8211; History is suggestive of fall in setting of electrolyte distribution and consequential lightheadedness.   Does not seem cardiac in origin, however Q waves in inferior leads appear to have progressed from last EKG on 2/20/67.  Protected fall argues against acute arrhythmic event.


Check orthostatics

Will check cardiac enzymes as EKG is suggestive of progressive Q waves in inferior leads.

Monitor on telemetry.

Physical therapy consult.



##: Anemia &#8211; Hct at baseline, however was iron deficit in 6/65 and had a tubular adenoma resection on colo.  Will repeat iron studies to ensure iron replete.  


Fe, TIBC, ferritin

Consider repeat outpt colonoscopy to r/o GI malignancy/lesion contributing to anemia



##: Elevated anion gap.  Delta-delta is 8/6=1.3= Pure metabolic acidosis.  Osmolar gap is &lt;10 so ingestion is less likely.  There are no ketones in the UA and there is no evidence of renal failure.  pH is not suggestive of an acidosis.  AG is likely from severe metabolic disarray (decreased anions and cations).


Check lactate

Repeat AG



##: Leukocytosis - no evidence of infection, although infection could contribute to confusion.  UA and CXR were negative.  If persistent or febrile will obtain cultures.  Repeat CBC


##: Diabetes &#8211; continue metformin, glyburide


Finger sticks AC with RISS



##: Schizophrenia &#8211; continue trilafon

##: Insomnia &#8211; continue seroquel, ambient

##: Hypertension &#8211; continue avapro, labetalol, norvasc, spironolactone, aspirin

##: Hyperlipidemia &#8211; continue simvastatin






FEN: 1L fluid restriction, no caffeine.  Aggressively replete K, phos and recheck lytes Q6H.



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: not indicated

DVT: Ambulatory

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn
