8/12/97 TTE: Left Ventricle: The left ventricle is normal in size. There is mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy. Overall left ventricular function is normal. The estimated ejection fraction is 55-60% with beat-to-beatvariation. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities. Echocardiographic assessment is consistent with normal diastolic function. Nl RV, mild LAE, Mild RAE, mild to moderate MR with an eccentric laterally-directed jet, mild to moderate TR, w/estimated PASP 24.


A/P: 66M with MMP including HTN, CHF, DM2, ESRD on HD, AF, and h/o PEA arrest who presents for routine follow up after recent bleeding AVF admission and ED visits.


#. CV: BP well controlled today, but in the absence of his wife it is entirely unclear what medications he is taking.  We had added imdur at our last visit for BP and antianginal control, and I had suggested re-starting Diltiazem.  It is unclear if either of these changes are occurring.  I will attempt to call his wife to discuss medication regimen, and we will hold on any changes for now.
       - F/u with Dr. Vest
       - Follow INR
       - Discuss current cardiac regimen with his wife


#. Oliguric ESRD: He had been doing well via his AVF but with recent sutures after bleeding they have been using his tunneled HD line, which now remains since 3/30/97 unless changed over wire at HD.  He is dialyzed at Ochsner Health Center Denham Springs in Pahrump. His Nephrologist is Dr. Frank Marquez, and he is pageable at951-440-0959 (Northwest Hospital).  


#. GI: His LFTs are now normal, and his HCV viral load/genotype have not been able to be determined.  It is possible that he has cleared HCV infection in the past.  We will continue to follow HCV viral  load and consider referral to GI to discuss treatment if LFTs rise of unclear etiology.  His synthetic function is mostly preserved.  #. DM2: Again, in the absence of his wife it is difficult to determine his current regimen.  Last A1C was 6.0, and with recent evidence we will continue his current regimen.
  
#. OSA: Sleep study completed, qualifies for CPAP, and using with good effect.  


#. Other: Repeat utility letter
