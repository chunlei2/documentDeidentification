69 y.o. male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 presents today to ODC ED with progressively worsening shortness of breath and intermittent left jaw pain. 

The patient reports having undergone CABG in September 2092 at WMMC after developing jaw pain and shortness of breath. He was told at that time that there might be a problem with one of the grafts. Surgery otherwise uneventful. He was discharged home and developed recurrent symptoms. Cardiac catheterization was performed in early Jan 2093 at BS which, by his report, showed one occluded graft. He underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. Relook coronary angiography was performed about 2 weeks later showing no change. He saw Dr. Paulson for 2nd opinion about 2 months ago. His review of angio from Jan: SVG to mid RCA patent, LIMA to 2nd diagonal patent, SVG to LAD not seen and extensive LAD disease. LAD intramyocardial. LV function normal. Ranexa was added however he has not noted any improvement in jaw pain. He has progressively worsening dyspnea on exertion and intermittent exertional left jaw pain partially relieved by 2 s.l. TNG. Despite greatly curtailing his activities, he is having daily symptoms. He has been enrolled at cardiac rehab but can only bicycle 2.8 mins. He phoned Dr. Paulson's office today and was advised to come to the ODC ED for evaluation.

In the ED, he appears comfortable and painfree. Did note some left jaw pain earlier. HR 73 SR, BP 122/71, O2 sat 98% RA. ECG showed NSR rate 71, incomplete RBBB with LAFB, LAE, TWI V1-V2-no important change c/w prior tracing 2/18/93. BNP, CK-MB, and TnT normal. CXR shows clear lungs.

In light of his history of CAD, CABG, prior PCI, and progressive symptoms, admitted for further evaluation.
