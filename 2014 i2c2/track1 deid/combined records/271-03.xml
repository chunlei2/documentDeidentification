Vascular Surgery/Emergency Department Surgical Admission Note



                                                                                                             

Patient: Jorgenson, Andrew C.  

MRN: 9125902

Date: 8/11/05



CC: cool right foot and progressive claudication



HPI: The patient is a 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass with PTFE (5/00) who presents to the ED with right foot pain. 



The patient has developed progressive R calf pain over the past 2 months, which has become worse over the past 10 days. 
He is unable to walk more than a half block without cramping pain in his calf.  Because of his previous bypass surgery and current complaints, he underwent vascular studies today demonstrating critical atherosclerotic disease in the RLE, with markedly reduced flow through the R graft. 
The toe-brachial index was not able to be calculated on the R, and was 0.31 on the L.   He is currently taking ASA 325 mg po daily, but no plavix or Coumadin.  



Over the past week, the patient reports that his pain has become more severe.  He has otherwise felt well and in his normal state of health, and denies fevers/chills, chest pain, shortness of breath, and all other symptoms.

Imaging:

Vascular studies done today, OSH: 
patent right femoral to popliteal artery bypass graft with markedly reduced flow, toe-brachial index 0.0 &#8211; confirmed with PVR in UMH ED



Assessment/Plan:
 

The patient is an 74 yo male with a history of CAD, PVD, s/p right femoral to above knee popliteal bypass graft who presents with progressive R foot claudication X 2 weeks.  His vascular studies are concerning for progressive arterial ischemia, presumably the result of graft stenosis. 



He will be admitted to the vascular surgery service, be placed on systemic heparin, and will undergo angiogram in the next 1-2 days for possible angioplasty/stent.



Plan:

-          Systemic anticoagulation w/ IV heparin, bolus 3000 units followed by drip at 1000 units/hr

-          Home meds

-          NPO past midnight

-          Mucormyst/bicarbonate for renal protection given creatinine 1.99

-          Plan for likely angiogram tomorrow, 8/12/05



This patient was discussed with Dr. Francis Pratt, Vascular Surgery Fellow.
