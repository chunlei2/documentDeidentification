Patient is here for follow-up.



1. CAD.  Patient admitted to the hospital in middle of November after she presented with pulmonary edema.  Ruled in for an MI and subsequent cardiac catheterization showed three vessel disease and she underwent three vessel CABG.  Postoperative course relatively smooth although she had been postoperative pneumothorax and had a chest tube which was only needed briefly.  Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.  Has not had any further recurrence of these symptoms.



Since her discharge patient has been doing quite well, no complaints of any chest pain, gets a little bit short of breath after exerting herself for a while but this is secondary to lack of conditioning and comes on gradually and results quickly as she rests.  Has more energy, had previously asked for a walk of a core she felt weak and now does not feel the need for this.  Also had had some lower extremity edema and this has now resolved.  Reports compliance with her new medical regimen with no untoward effects.  She was discharged to home without aspirin.  Patient followed by Dr. Nesbitt and has a follow-up appointment with him end of January, also has follow-up appointment with cardiothoracic surgery.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Patient had a gastric ulcer last July, biopsy without any evidence of malignancy and no evidence of H. pylori.  During recent hospitalization had a follow-up EGD which showed no evidence of continued disease.  Patient does report that for the past two nights she has woken up during the night with some stomach discomfort.  This seemed to have been relieved this morning by Prilosec.  Not using any NSAIDs.



Social History: Living with her daughter for the moment in Culpeper Colorado but hoping to move back to her own apartment in Adrian.



Physical Exam



Patient is in no apparent distress.

Weight: 114 pounds

Blood Pressure: 114/56

Neck: supple without thyroidomegaly, no lymphadenopathy.  Without JVD.

Lungs: Clear.

Cor. S1, S2 without gallops, rubs or murmurs.

Abdomen: non-tender, without organomegaly. 

Extremities: without edema. 



Assessment and Plan



1.  CAD.  Doing quite well, continue current regimen.  Patient to call if any new complaints or problems, recurrence of chest pain.  Will speak with Dr. Nesbitt regarding whether she should restart aspirin q.day, contact patient if recommendation is to restart.



2.  Gastric ulcer.  Recent repeat EGD with no evidence of recurrent disease.  Now with some recurrence of epigastric pain.  For the moment she will increase omeprazole to 20 mg b.i.d. and take if this does for several weeks and then go back to previous dose.  If continues to have epigastric pain or needs higher dose of omeprazole will need further investigation.



I will see her for follow-up in two months.
