JONES,URIEL   222-67-70-8                    VISIT DATE: 07/19/25

Seen with Dr. Person.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY, SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, REVIEW OF 

SYSTEMS, MEDICATIONS, ALLERGIES:  Were reviewed and confirmed.  

Please see Resident note for further details.  

HISTORY:  I interviewed and examined the patient myself.  The 

history briefly is as follows.  This is a 51 year-old male who was 

recently discharged from the hospital here after a successful 

percutaneous lithotripsy and nephrostomy placement.  He presented 

this evening for a leakage from his nephrostomy tube which he 

believes may have become dislodged or had its cap removed when he 

was sitting on the sofa and got up.  He has been leaking 

serosanguineous fluid since earlier today.  He has no fever, 

chills.  No other complaints.  

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Includes diabetes, hypertension, CAD, high 

cholesterol.  

MEDICATIONS:  He takes hydrochlorothiazide, Zestril, Calan, Zocor 

and Levaquin.   

ALLERGIES:  He has no allergies to medications.  

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise negative.  

SOCIAL HISTORY:  He lives with his family.  

FAMILY HISTORY:  He has no significant family history.  

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  His temperature is 99.2, heart rate 93, 

blood pressure 136/81.  He is an awake and alert male in no acute 

distress.  HEENT - Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Oropharynx clear.  

Neck is supple.  Chest clear to auscultation bilaterally.  

Cardiovascular exam is regular rate and rhythm without murmur, rub 

or gallop.  Abdomen is soft, nontender.  Mildly obese.  Skin is 

warm and dry.  Left flank is with some resolving ecchymosis.  No 

obvious subcutaneous fluid, and the area around the nephrostomy 

drain is intact.  His gurney linens are soaked with serosanguineous 

fluid.  Extremities without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  

Neurologically alert and oriented.  Cranial nerves II-XII are 

intact.  No motor or sensory deficits.   

CONSULTATIONS:  He is seen in consultation by the Urology Service 

and his tubing was cut back and cap replaced.  It is unclear as 

this was placed by Radiology exactly the exact 

configuration of the tubing.  However, it appears to have ceased 

leak at this time.  

DISPOSITION:  He is discharged in satisfactory condition with 

instructions to return for return of symptoms or for any other 

concerns, and to call to have follow up arranged for early next 

week.
