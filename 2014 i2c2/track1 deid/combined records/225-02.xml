	Narrative Note:
   Chief Complaint
Cardiology Admission Note
Christopher Powell
# 070 27 68

5/20/94 at 11:30 am

Mr Powell is admitted to Cardiology clinic s/p cath and PTCA/stent (2.25 x 12 Taxus) to the LAD

	
History of Present Illness

This 69 yo gentleman has a hx of CAD dating back several years. He underwent CABG x 3 in 2092 at WMMC after being diagnosed with CAD after presenting with symptoms of jaw pain and SOB. Immediately after surgery he was told there was likely a problem with one of the grafts. He began to have symptoms of jaw pain and dypnea within a few weeks of surgery and presented to Beloit State where he had cath within 6 weeks of CABG- at that time his LAD graft was down and his distal LAD was stenosed. Failed attempt to stent the distal LAD, but it was PTCA'd with no real relief of his symptoms. Last year, he presented here with further progression of his anginal equivalent and underwent cath which showed further stenosis of the distal LAD. There was no PCI option available. 

He has been aggressively managed with medications and initially his jaw pain improved, but the dyspnea has persisted. Unfortunately the jaw pain has reoccurred and he has become more symptomatic. He now presented for cath. 

Today he arrived via SDA for cath that showed his native disease to be severe with a 70% stenosis involving the ostium of the first diagonal branch. The mid-distal LAD is small and tapering with diffuse disease  up to 80%. The first diagonal has a high grade ostial stenosis. LCX has 40-50% stenosis proximal to the first OM. RCA has 80% stenosis proximally with competitive flow from the SVG. The LIMA-&gt; D1 is patent and the SVG-&gt; RCA is patent. The SVG-&gt; LAD is not visualized. The mid-LAD lesion was treated with PTCA/stenting with a 2.25 x 12 mm Taxus stent. He arrived on floor 5 pain free and in no distress.

Disposition and Plans
Impression: 69 yo with CAD, s/p CABG with early graft stenosis, now s/p PTCA/stent to mid LAD w/DES

	
Plan:

	
1. Cardiac: HR/BP well controlled. Continue current meds. Full dose ASA and plavix indefinitely. Stop PPI on plavix with new DES. Recently increase lipitor to 40 mg QD- will check fasting lipids in am along with LFT's. Adjust dose further as needed. Remove sheath once PTT normalizes. Ambulate once activity restrictions lifted. 

Continue nitrates for now given intramyocardial vessel and severe native distal LAD disease. Increase activity post DC as tolerated.. 

2. Endo: Diabetic on glyburide- continue for now. Check FS BID- insulin scale as needed. 

3. GI: on protonix- will change to zantac while on plavix to prevent drug interaction with PPI's/plavix. Guaiac all stools

4. Psych: anxiety/depression- continue lexapro

	
Further plans per Dr Paulson
