Fellow: Godfrey, Stanley

Patient: Vieira, Nathan B.
MRN: 0666729
Date: 3/8/2081


HPI: This is a 74 y.o. M with h.o CAD and PVD s/p bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting procedures complicated by a thrombus in the L side of the iliac portion of the graft for which he has been on coumadin. In anticipation for a follow-up cardiac catheterization (recent episodes of shortness of breath), his coumadin was held since Thursday (3/6/2081). Then on 3/7/2081, he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity. The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks. He complained of both numbness and pain, and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2.0. Dr. Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH. He arrives today (3/8/2081) on a heparin drip.



PHMx: 


DM (insulin-dependent)
CAD (recent echo showed EF 55-60% but inferior wall infarct in 9/2080; stress test in 11/2080 showed no reversible ischemia)
