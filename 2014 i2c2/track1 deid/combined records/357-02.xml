disease who presented to Emergency Department after an episode of

confusion associated with a blood sugar in the field to 67 (per

EMS) and responsive to orange juice with normal mental status

upon arrival in the ED.  On further history, it seems that the

patient took her usual dose of insulin this morning and ate

breakfast but missed lunch and dinner because of a flood in the

basement that had preoccupied her.  She has had prior episodes of

been feeling well.  No recent change in medications.
