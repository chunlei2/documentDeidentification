	Interval History:
   Mr Innis is a 77 y.o male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and CAD. His cardiac history dates back to March 2095 when he experienced dyspnea and exertional chest pressure that radiated to his jaw and arms. Cardiac catheterization at that time showed LAD disease and he underwent PTCA/Taxus stent to his LAD. 

He did well until August 2096 when he presented with a dull mid scapular discomfort that radiated to his upper chest. These symptoms were accompanied by diaphoresis, dyspnea and transient blurry vision. After evaluation and clearance by Neurology he underwent another cardiac catheterization. Catheterization revealed his LAD stent was patent but he had a 90% lesion proximal to the stent. He had PTCA/Vision stent to his LAD. 

Since 11/19/2096 he has had complaints of increasing dyspnea on exertion and chest pressure. He was treated with antibiotics and prednisone with relief of his dyspnea. He continues with daily exertional chest discomfort that resolves with rest and sl nitroglycerin. 

Today he presented for elective cardiac catheterization which show ed a proximal 90% occlusion and mild In stent restenosis. He had a cypher stent placed in his LAD. He arrived in Cardiology pain free and hemodynamically stable.
