Internal Medicine C Admission Note



PATIENT:  Veda Edgar

MRN: 9262764

ADMIT DATE: 3/4/2124

ATTENDING:  Brenda Youmans (ward)

PCP: Arthur Qin

Code status: FULL (per chart)

CC:  



Persistent cough



HPI:



Ms. Edgar is a 64 year-old frequently hospitalized woman with CHFpEF (EF = 71%), COPD on 2.5L home O2 and chronic steroids (currently 10 mg prednisone), OSA on BiPAP, CKD, and chronic pain on chronic narcotics, who presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum after recently being treated for influenza.  According to the patient, she left the hospital, completed the course of Tamiflu and azithromycin on 2/24, and continued to feel poorly, with a chronic nagging cough that was productive of dark green sputum. 
No fever, chills, sweats, myalgias, or SOB.  Yesterday, she developed worsening pain, especially in her ribs, extending across the anterior surface; she said the pain is worse with movement but does not vary with respiration or cough.  She is unable to ambulate, as she states she does at baseline with a walker.  



This is her tenth hospital and fourteenth ED visit to MCH in the past year (there are records in the chart of OSH visits as well).  On interview she is tearful regarding her readmission, stating that she &#8220;tries so hard&#8221; to stay out of the hospital, &#8220;but what am I supposed to do when I am sick?&#8221;



ED Course:



In the ED, a CXR showed a RLL patchy opacity suggestive of pneumonia. She received 750 mg levofloxacin, 1 g vancomycin, nebulizer treatments, and morphine for pain control.  



ROS



On interview, she endorses only rib pain and back and hip pain that she says is chronic from her spinal stenosis.  She also complains of the chronic cough described above.  No CP, SOB, dysuria, pyuria, N/V/D.

MICROBIOLOGY:



Blood cultures and urine cultures from ED on 3/4 pending

No respiratory sample sent.



RADIOLOGY:



CXR (3/4): RLL patchy opacity.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN



64 year-old morbidly obese woman with DM2, OSA, COPD on 2.5L home O2, OSA, recently treated for influenza A, presents with persistent cough productive of green sputum and rib pain.



#)  Productive cough: Has leukocytosis and haziness especially on lateral CXR.  In the absence of other symptoms (new O2 requirement, SOB, pleuritic chest pain, fevers/chills), a diagnosis of pneumonia is difficult to make.  However, she is on chronic steroids and narcotics at baseline and may not mount a typical symptomatic response.

-        Continue HAP coverage started in ED (vanc+cef)
 for seven days
-        Respiratory cultures ordered



#)  Multiple re-hospitalizations: as above, she has been admitted at ten times in the past year just to MCH alone.  A viable long-term plan for outpatient management is essential.

      -  Consider complex care committee consult this admission



#)  Prophy:  Fragmin 5000; senna+colace; H2 blocker (given chronic steroid use)



#)  F/E/N: regular diet.
