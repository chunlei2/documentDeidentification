HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 47-year-old female who returns to the clinic for a followup visit.  The patient has multiple medical problems including severe and extreme hypertension as well as high blood pressure and chronic renal failure for which she is currently attending dialysis sessions 3 times per week.  The patient also is currently being treated for hot flashes with Prempro.  The patient states that she ran out of her blood pressure medications including the patch 2 days ago.  She also complains of frequent popping and loss of hearing in her right ear.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A middle-aged female in no acute distress.  Blood pressure is 182/94, weight is 211 pounds, and pulse is 76.  Chest is clear bilaterally.  Heart, regular rate and rhythm, positive S1, S2.  Negative S3, S4, no murmur.  Abdomen is soft, nontender, positive bowel sounds.  Lower extremities, no edema, nontender.



IMPRESSION AND PLAN:

1.  Chronic renal failure, on dialysis.  The patient appears to be doing much better and has stabilized on her regular dialysis sessions.  She is still waiting for donor for a renal transplant.  She will follow up with nephrology as scheduled.  She is currently being immunized for her transplant and will receive her third hepatitis B shot as well as her second hepatitis A shot today.

2.  Right ear problem.  The patient has wax buildup in her right ear and I recommended that she use olive oil on a nightly basis to resolve the earwax.

3.  Diabetes mellitus.  Control is much better.  There is a recent hemoglobin A1c of 6.3.

4.  Severe hyperlipidemia, which has improved after the patient was started on dialysis.  Of note, was also a very high HDL.  The patient is currently on no hypolipemic medication.  We will check a fasting lipid profile at this point.

5.  Severe hypertension.  Prescriptions for nifedipine and the clonidine patch were refilled.

6.  Hyperparathyroidism.  We will check a PTH level today.
