Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Has been feeling well. 



Home Blood Tests:  Records downloaded from meter with little detail and somewhat scattered BS.

B 	57-448

L	71-222

S	101-254

HS	163-399

No food records. No severe hypoglycemia. Has had a couple of nocturnal reactions. There are not enough data points to determine whether the Lantus dose is appropriate.



Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon over the spring. Has had extensive laser in the past, and had some last year OS after her surgery.

Nephropathy:	Her creatinine was stable at 1.3 in July

Neuropathy:	Feet are not bothering her. Sometimes has a peculiar diffuse tingling sensation precipitated by motion. 

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion. Has been able to exercise in the gym twice a week, walking steadily at a pretty fast pace for an hour. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: no significant changes

Immunizations. Has not had flu shot yet this year. Had the second of hepatitis A series in L deltoid today.



Review of Systems: above

Breast: Saw Dr. Bruce a few weeks ago. Ultrasound showed what is being interpreted as a stable slightly enlarge intramammary lymph node. She find the lower part of the sternotomy scar to be very uncomfortable in most bras and wants to consider whether it can be improved.

Gyn: Overdue to see Yareli Kilgore; she will make the appointment.

Skin: Has noted some crusting lesions on her scalp.



Physical Exam:	

Looks well. In very good spirits. Jake is with her.

BP:   134/80		P:   72	Seated

BP:   116/76		P:   76	Standing

Wt:   168 without shoes, stable

HEENT:	Anicteric. 

Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits

Chest:	Clear to percussion and auscultation

	There is a small keloid at the inferior portion of the median sternotomy scar

Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  No gallops.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Abdomen:	No hepatosplenomegaly. No masses. No tenderness. No palpable AAA. 

Extremities:	No edema.        DP 1+,=.  PT 1+,=.  No open areas of feet. Has several toe deformities, dystrophic nails and probable onychomycosis.

Skin:	Crusting lesion on scalp



Impressions and Plan:	

Hard to assess control. She is reluctant to keep hand records.

Will try to add an ACE inhibitor again. Start captopril 6.25 mg bid and increase the 12.5 mg bid if tolerated. Check BP at home.

She would like to consider treatment for onychomycosis. Would suggest that Dr. Xie send a paring for fungal culture before we consider it. Also, LFTs were slightly abnormal in July and will need to be repeated. Finally, would have to check medication incompatibilities before proceeding.

Refer to Dr. xia for consideration of modification of her sternotomy scar. Warned her that he may not feel that it is a good idea either on pure surgical grounds on because of her immunosuppression, but it is worth asking his opinion.

Refer to Dr. Keeler for evaluation of scalp lesions.

Flu shot R deltoid with usual preamble. Aventis Fluzone Lot L5317YR. Exp. 7/10/76.

A1c, SGOT, SGPT, alkaline phosphatase, Bili T/D, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine again in 1 month if she is taking captopril at that time.
