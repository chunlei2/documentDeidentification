This patient was seen with Dr. Nabor Jacoby.
 
HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 29 year old woman with diabetes and 
obesity.  Her problems are as follows:
 
1.   Diabetes.  She was sent to me from OB/GYN because of her high glucose 
     and she was put on insulin by me.  Xitlali Xia followed her in 
     order to get her on a good dose but then she was lost to follow up as 
     she did not come to her appointments and did not return phone calls.  
     She finally comes back and I am relieved, but she has not brought any 
     list of her blood sugars.  She says she does take them about twice a 
     day and she did write them down but her daughter ripped them up and 
     threw them away.  She says that they never go higher than 200; that 
     they usually are about 110.  It was 101 this morning before 
     breakfast, she says.  She says it does get as low as 19 and five or 
     six times it has been below 50.  She does say she eats three regular 
     meals but then later in the morning when I asked her if she had eaten 
     breakfast she said no.  She is seeing a nutritionist this morning.
 
     I will check a hemoglobin A1C today.  I expressed to her again how 
     important it is that she eat three regular meals, but not sweets.  
     She had been eating a lot of chocolate.  She says she has gotten off 
     of a lot of this although she does have cravings for it and eats it 
     then.  She is going to a nutritionist today and I hope that she will 
     help her with her diet.  If her diet does get better, maybe we can 
     wean her off the insulin and try Micronase.  I explained to her, too, 
     that if she both had a good diet and lost some weight that we might 
     be able to get her off the insulin.  This seemed to be something that 
     she would like to do.  Hopefully the nutritionist can help.  I also 
     told her that in order to find out what was going on that I need her 
     to take her blood sugar before breakfast, lunch, dinner and sleep, 
     and then come back in a week and a half so that we can see what was 
     really going on and whether they are getting too low.  She denies any 
     kind of symptoms with even as low a blood sugar as 19.  I am 
     wondering if she is remembering all these blood sugars correctly.  
     She had no shakiness, no loss of consciousness, no dizziness, no 
     nothing.  She felt totally normal.  So hopefully she will really 
     record these and we will get a better idea.  She said this always 
     happens in the morning.  She kept contradicting herself and had no 
     documentation.  I went over with her the symptoms of hypoglycemia.  
     Once she had a low blood sugar by fingerstick.  She does drink juice, 
     but I went over the symptoms again with her.  She will call me if she 
     does have any.

2.   Left ankle pain.  I sent her to the orthopedist as she requested.  
     She said that she may do some surgery on her.
 
3.   Dysuria.  She says this is totally resolved after giving her the 
     Bactrim.
 
4.   Yeast infection.  She said this has also resolved.
 
5.   She complains of headache.  She says these have been going on for two 
     or three months; that light and noise bother her when she has some.  
     She has had nausea and vomited once.  This happened pretty much every 
     day and it can be at any time of the day.  Tylenol and Advil did not 
     help.  She knows she is going to have a headache because it starts in 
     the back of her left ear very faintly and then it spreads from there.  
     But she has no further prodrome.  She says it is a banging kind of 
     pain that is rhythmic.  She also says she does see stars in front of 
     her eyes when it happens.  I asked her if she had any hearing loss, 
     and she said that she hears voices but people are not there 
     sometimes.  It has been happening for a couple of weeks.  I discussed 
     this with Dr. Jacoby and we both agreed that these do sound like 
     migraines.  I will not image her head now as there is no evidence 
     that this would be something to do with brain tumor.  Her neuro exam 
     was totally normal.  Cranial nerves II-XII were checked and intact.  
     Her gait was normal.  Light touch was touched.  Her toes were 
     downgoing.  Her reflexes were symmetric bilaterally.  Her disks were 
     sharp.  EOMI, PERRL.  I gave her a prescription for Motrin, 600 mg PO 
     t.i.d. and told her to take one the minute she got the pain behind 
     her left ear.  I will see her in a week and a half to reassess this.
 
6.   Health maintenance.  I thought that since she is diabetic and obese 
     that she might benefit from a flu shot.  She has no interest in this 
     at all.  Her blood pressure was 110/70 in the left arm with a thigh 
     cuff.  Her pulse was 96.  Her blood sugar was 151 and her weight was 
     285.
