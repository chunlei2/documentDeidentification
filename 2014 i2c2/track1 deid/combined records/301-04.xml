ID/CC: presumed lung rejection s/p lung transplant


HPI: 
Mr. Albert is a 44-year-old man with bronchiectasis who underwent bilateral lung transplantation in July 2073. He was seen in the post-transplant clinic on 10/29/2079 with complaints of worsening dyspnea on exertion over the preceding two weeks to the point that he has been symptomatic with ADLs and after walking 4-5 steps. He says that his prednisone dose was decreased from 12.5 to 10 mg daily approximately 1 month ago and that his tacrolimus dose had been decreased earlier this year. At baseline, he is on supplemental oxygen (2L NC at rest and 4L NC with exertion). He denied F/C/cough/chest pain/jaw or L arm pain/sick contacts. Recently had a treadmill ETT and TTE in Florida. Also some morning headaches for the past 5 days. Denies vision change, sinus pain or drainage. No recent leg pain/swelling or prolonged travel. No recent travel outside of Fountain Of The Four Rivers area. Has a puppy at home; no other recent animal contact. No recent falls. His PFTs demonstrated a worsening FEV1 and CT scan demonstrates evidence of worsening obstruction, likely related to rejection. He is being admitted for treatment of acute on chronic rejection.


ROS:   negative in detail except as noted above.

Microbiology:
10/29/79 CMV antigenemia negative (was low-positive most recently in 7/74)


Imaging:
Chest CT 10/29/2079Scattered mosaic attenuation vs. GGO, bronchiectasis, mildly increased since 5/14/2079.No effusions or lymphadenopathy.


Studies
Floor EKG:NSR at 80, NL intervals &amp; ST-segments. No significant change from priors.


10/29/79 CXR:No evidence of anastomotic rupture. No signs of pneumonia, acute or chronic rejection, lymphoproliferative disease. Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits without signs of CHF.


10/29/79 chest CT: worsening airway obstruction per pulmonary fellow; official radiology read pending


Impression and Plan:
44y M with bronchiectasis s/p bilateral lung transplant, presenting with dyspnea. Concerning for acute-on-chronic rejection. PCP also a consideration with subacute dyspnea, but pt has been on appropriate prophylaxis and CXR/chest CT not suggestive of PCP. No other sx suggesting an infectious etiology, including sinusitis.


1.       Resp. Dyspnea, concerning for acute-on-chronic lung rejection.
-    methylprednisolone 500 IV qday x 3 days, then prednisone taper
-    continuing other outpatient immunosupressants; following daily tacrolimus levels
-    IV ganciclovir while on high-dose steroids
-    Check sputum gram stain + culture


2.       Renal: CRI at baseline (baseline Cr 1.9-2.3). Renal dosing for all medications.


3.       FEN
- no concentrated sweets, low saturated fat, low sodium; follow BID FSG while on pulse-dose steroids


4.       Prophy:   enoxaparin; omeprazole (on PPI as outpatient)


5.       Dispo:pending improvement in dyspnea &amp; functional status
