Diabetes mellitus : Good control. Check A1c today.



Depression : Her brother died recently and he was her main companion. She seems to be grieving appropriately but is somewhat isolated without much in the way of social or other activities. Has lost about 9# since 10/63 due to poor appetite. Does not wish to take any more meds. I will see her more frequently.
