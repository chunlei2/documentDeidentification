Chief Complaint

urosepsis



History of Present Illness

Mr. Quin is well known to me. He has a severely dysfunctional bladder and severe urethral stricture 2/2 radiation therapy for prostate CA. He has been dependent on a SP tube for bladder drainage, however, after the past 2 SP tube changes, he has developed urosepsis. He now presents again in urosepsis after his most recent SP tube change. He also complains of bilateral pelvic/hip pain which is limiting his ability to walk without a walker. This is a marked change over the past 3 months.

Assessment

1. Urosepsis - Treat as you are with Levofloxacin.

2. Bilateral hip pain - given subacute nature of this worsening problem, I would obtain a CT scan of the lower abdomen/pelvis to r/o any drainable fluid collections that we cannot appreciate on PE.

3. Long term plan - I have discussed with Mr. Quin that we are likely headed toward needing a surgical urinary diversion with an ileal conduit. He understands this and is still considering this. We will continue this discussion in outpatient follow up.
