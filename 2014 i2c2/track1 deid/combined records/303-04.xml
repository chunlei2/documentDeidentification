Sens:   

As noted above on the face. LT and temperature intact. Joint position intact.  Vibration intact.  No evidence of extinction or graphesthesia.



Gait:    Deferred







Labs/Studies:

BUN/Cr 58/2.08 Glu 111 Tn negative W 9.5 plt 262 INR 1.1



A/P: 76 RH F with prior CVA with minimal dysarthria at baseline HTN, HL, here with sx most consistent with idiopathic Bells palsy of the L. face given lower motor neuron distribution of her findings. Other considerations include recrudescence of her prior CVA sx, vs. HTN urgency/emergency.



Plan:

MRI/A of the brain with susceptibility to r/o CVA

BP control goal SBP &lt; 160 mm Hg

If negative for CVA, dx likely idiopathic bells which is a clinical dx. 

If above etiologies CVA, HTn related recrudescence of CVA sx negative, would favor initiating impiric tx for idiopathic bells with steroids and valacyclovir

May continue to follow up with PCP

If sx do not improve after trial of tx for Bells, then call Internal Medicine for appt. 415-726-3969
