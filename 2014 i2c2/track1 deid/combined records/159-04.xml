                                              11-30-93 



IDENTIFICATION:  Ms. Youngman is a 36 year old woman with the following 
medical problems: 

1.   Type II diabetes mellitus.
2.   CAD.
3.   History of CIN2 status post laser treatment to the cervix.
4.   Depression.
5.   History of substance abuse.
6.   GERD.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Enteric-coated aspirin 325mg PO q.d., atenolol 
25mg PO q.d., glyburide 5mg PO q.d., Lipitor 10mg PO q.h.s., Celexa 20mg 
PO q.d., Zantac 150mg PO q.h.s., Prevacid 30mg PO q.d., trazodone 150mg 
PO q.h.s.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Youngman returns to clinic today to 
follow up regarding her diabetes, coronary artery disease, and 
depression.  Since I last saw her, she presented to Urgent Care 
complaining of some epigastric discomfort and was referred to 
Gastroenterology where apparently she was started on Prevacid at 30mg a 
day in addition to maintenance with q.h.s. Zantac and scheduled for a 
upper GI series with a small bowel follow-through with a plan to add a 
pro-motility agent if there was no structural abnormalities on her GI 
study.  She is scheduled later this month.  She has no new complaints, 
although she recently stopped taking her glyburide and has not refilled 
it over the past two days.  She denies any increasing polyuria, 
polydipsia, polyphagia.  Says until yesterday, she had been taking all 
of her medications regularly, although mostly at night rather than in 
the morning.  I pressed her about this because she has a history of 
being noncompliant with her medicines in the past, but she does maintain 
that she has been taking them.  It is not entirely clear to me whether 
this is true or not.  

Regarding her depression, she denies any suicidal ideation.  She says 
she is feeling a little bit better.  She was recently started on 
risperidone in addition to her Celexa, apparently by a psychiatrist at 
the Connerstone Regional Hospital by the name of Dr. Lehman whom she sees once 
a month.  She is also seeing a counselor there weekly.  She says overall 
she is doing a little bit better, although still intermittently binge 
drinking and occasionally smoking marijuana.  We again discussed the 
importance of AA; she says she is not interested in that.  

Regarding her coronary disease, she continues to have exertional angina 
after approximately 14 steps which has not increased in intensity or 
frequency.  She denies any PND or orthopnea, denies any chest pain at 
rest.

PHYSICAL EXAM:  She is a morbidly obese woman in no acute distress.  Her 
pulse is 80 and regular, blood pressure 134/74.  Her weight today is 
249lb.  Her sclera are nonicteric.  Her JVP is not visible at 90 
degrees.  There are no carotid bruits.  Her lungs are clear to 
auscultation bilaterally, and her cardiac exam reveals a regular rhythm, 
positive S1, S2.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops appreciated.  Her 
extremities are warm and without significant edema.  Her finger stick 
blood sugar in the office today was 331.

ASSESSMENT/PLAN:  Thirty six year old woman with multiple medical 
problems, including a history of noncompliance and substance abuse.

1.   Diabetes.  Her last hemoglobin A1C was approximately 9.3, 
     essentially unchanged from six months prior.  Finger stick in the 
     office is 331 today, confirming her recent noncompliance and would 
     now describe that she has not been taking her medicine regularly 
     over the past couple of months.  In any event, she most likely need 
     a higher dose of sulphonurea.  We will check a hemoglobin A1C 
     today, and if it remains in the 9 range or higher, will increase 
     her glyburide to 10mg daily, and I talked to her about the plan.  
     Her last urine microalbumin was negative.

2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  When she returns to clinic in three months, 
     we will recheck a lipid profile by which time she will have been on 
     Lipitor for approximately six months.

3.   Coronary disease.  She is still having exertional chest pain.  
     Increased her atenolol to 50mg PO q.d. as she did have room to go 
     with her pulse and blood pressure.

4.   Depression.  I again encouraged her to continue following up with 
     her psychiatrist and her counselor.  Again, reinforced the 
     importance of trying to remain substance free and recommended AA 
     again as I have in the past.

5.   GERD.  She will follow up with Gastroenterology and continue on her 
     PPI and H2 blocker for now.  I told her she should take the 
     Prevacid in the morning and the Zantac at night only.

6.   Health maintenance.  She received a flu shot and she will return to 
     clinic in three months to follow up on her diabetes, 
     hypercholesterolemia, and coronary disease.  Additionally, I 
     referred her to Nutrition for further counseling regarding weight 
     loss and a heart-healthy diabetic diet.  I also stressed the

     importance of her seeing the eye doctor.  She says she is scheduled 
     to see the eye doctor this month given that she is at risk for 
     diabetic retinopathy.
