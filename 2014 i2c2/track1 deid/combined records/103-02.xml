This patient was seen by the resident.  I confirm that I have

crushing pain going down her back.  However, the chest pain has 

been consistent since 9:00 to about 4:00 this morning.  No 

shortness of breath, diaphoresis, light-headedness, or dizziness.  

She did not take any nitroglycerin.  She presented to the emergency 

room today after she talked to her cardiologist, who wanted her to 

come to the emergency room for evaluation.  The patient denies 

taking any nitroglycerin and denies any chest pain episodes since 

her stent was placed back in November 2067.
