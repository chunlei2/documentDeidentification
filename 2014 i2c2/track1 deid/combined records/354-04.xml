Impression

DM- having problems with glucometer, but based on sisters measurements not too bad. ha1c has come down 0.7%.  Hopefully with better medical management will continue to drop.  Continues to have difficulty with medications. 

 

adrenal insufficiency- now off prednisone after gradual taper. 

 

lipids- back on statin, will check when due.

 

htn- high again today.  will plan to taper atenolol, as recent data show limits as treatment of hypertension, and add hctz/lisinopril, both are first line agents for htn. see back in two weeks.

 

back pain- pt appt next week
