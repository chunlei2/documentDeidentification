Dear Nurse Rivas, 




We had the pleasure of seeing Ruath Doss (MRN 49535763) back in Neurology Clinic today for stroke and subsequent seizures.  The patient was seen by myself and Dr. Isaac Ferraro. 





Ruath Doss is a 60yo RHF with a history of poorly controlled DM, htn, hypercholesterolemia, and G6PD deficiency who is followed here in Neurology clinic for multiple small L frontoparietal strokes complicated by seizures.  She had recovered well from her strokes, and has been seizure-free for two years on Dilantin.  She was last seen here in December 2091. 
Since that visit, she has had several significant health-related events: her breast biopsy was found to be negative, and she also underwent clipping of her incidentally found L ACA aneurysm via bifrontal craniotomy.  Dr. Gertrude Fulton performed this procedure in February which was uneventful.  However, an abdominal aortic aneurysm was found on an ultrasound for abdominal pain (attributed to biliary colic), so she is being followed for increase in size of the aneurysm as well as for any new cerebral aneurysms.  



Mrs. Doss still has some occasional burning pain over her right incision site, helpd with rubbing the area.  She had some bilateral lateral thigh numbness after the surgery, a recrudescence of old symptoms which improved after a bowel movement but which have not yet completely resolved.  She denies any recent seizures.  After discussing the results of the bone densitometry test with you, it was decided that she did not need additional calcium agents.

Assessment and Recommendations:



60yo RHF h/o DM, htn, hyperlipidemia returns to Neurology clinic for stroke complicated by seizures.  Her clinical examination remains intact.  She has been seizure free for two years at this point, including through intracranial surgery, and she is amenable to a trial of tapering off the Dilantin.  Given that her seizures occurred within a week of her stroke, and that her EEG at that time did not show epileptiform discharges, she is a good candidate for AED discontinuation.  Before doing so, we will obtain a baseline EEG to assess for cortical irritability.  Such an abnormality may be difficult to detect given her craniotomy; if the breech is significant, she would be a candidate for a MEG study.  If there are no epileptiform discharges, we can institute a taper off the Dilantin (decrease by 100mg every 5 days).  After she has been off the Dilantin for two weeks, we will again repeat an EEG.  She is aware that she will not be able to drive for 6 months after the Dilantin is stopped, and that there is an increased risk of seizures especially in the first 3 months.  



We discussed the importance of weight loss, as well as continued good diabetic, hypertensive, and lipid control for stroke prevention.  The weight loss will likely help resolve her meralgia paresthetica as well.  (It is not entirely clear how the constipation related to her symptoms.)  Given the new irregularity on her most recent carotid ultrasound, we will repeat the study once more to ensure that there has been no progression.  Mrs. Doss will call me after her EEG and carotid ultrasound have been completed so that we can discuss the results, and also to determine whether to taper off the Dilantin.  



Of note, Dr. Isaac Ferraro was present for all of the salient aspects of the history and physical exam. Together, we discussed with the patient the work-up and treatment plan.  Thank you for allowing us to continue to participate in the care of your patient.  As I am graduating from the residency program, she will be seen by a different resident in 6 months time.     





Sincerely, 






Yasmine Florence-Gagnon, MD
