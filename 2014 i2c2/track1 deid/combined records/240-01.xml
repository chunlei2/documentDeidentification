History of present illness

			

  Oneill was hospitalized at the Muscatine Health Center shortly after leaving the YCH following his catheterization and placement of the stent by Dr.  Hall.  Because of the recurrent chest pain at Muscatine Health he was catheterized again from the left groin and the stent seemed to be functioning normally.  He was given the usual supportive therapy and discharged.  He is now taking Isordil 30 mg SR daily as isosorbide mononitrate.  He takes metoprolol 25 mg one-half BID, Procardia XL 30 mg daily, furosemide 20 mg per day, K-Dur 20 mEq daily, Flomax 0.4 mg daily, Singulair 10 mg daily, Advair 25/50 mg daily, Prilosec 20 mg per day, terazosin 10 mg per day, and atorvastatin 10 mg HS.  He states that he feels completely well.  He has noted good healing in the left groin.  No new issues.

Assessment and plan

			

  I believe he will do well.  We will be starting his diuretic again now.  No more chest pain.  Followup will be with Dr.  Hall on schedule.  He will call if new symptoms develop.  Followup urinalysis and culture are planned.  Unable to pass his urine today, but will get one when possible and he will pass it here so that we can get a urinalysis as well.
