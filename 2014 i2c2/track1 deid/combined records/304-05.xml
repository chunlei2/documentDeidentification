Resident: Addison Keefe

Attending: Angel Vail

PCP: Felicia Ali

Source: Medical Record and Family



CC: L Arm Weakness



HPI:  28 yo RH M h/o DM1, ESRD on HD, HTN, Stroke (thought to be due to thrombocytosis), GTC in setting of HTN one year ago (and in June per family), multiple HTN episodes on many anti-hypertensives, RIJ thrombosis, had transient L arm weakness at HD followed by some difficulty speaking and change in his mental status.  He was reportedly in good health the night prior to admission and the morning of admission per his family, with no sick contacts and no travel.  At HD he was hypertensive with SBP in 200s, had transient L arm weakness and paresthesias which then resolved and had difficulty speaking and following commands after being noted by his nephrologist at an OSH to be mentating well with normal speech.  No urinary/bowel incontinence, tonic-clonic movements or syncope was noted by his providers.  He was brought to BMH ED because of these problems. 



	In the ED, his initial VS were BP 211/120 HR 88 T 98 R 18 SaO2 100% RA.   he received a Head CT which showed  no acute infarct or ICH  , an MRI which showed  no acute infarct on  DWI, but he was agitated in the scanner and could not complete the study.  He received 5 mg hydralazine iv x 2 and was started first in a TNG gtt and then on a nitroprusside gtt to 100/min titrated to a goal of MAP 120.  His BP was 251/104 at 2315. and was  His L Arm Weakness resolved, but he was agitated and he transiently wanted to leave AMA, and was admitted to the CCU for further management.

     4. On the left: Patent arterial tree



Renal Ultrasound Doppler 8/26/61

NO EVIDENCE OF HYDRONEPHROSIS.  SLIGHTLY ECHOGENIC KIDNEYS.  TRACE

     FREE FLUID.



A/P:  28 yo man with DM1, ESRD-HD, HTN, Hyperlipidemia, thrombocytosis, here with hypertensive emergency. His BP has remained high, so will attempt to reduce by 25% MAP for a few hours and then start an oral agent.  Nitroprusside will be used first but if he needs an extended treatment, will change to nicardipine (Bj Q Sugudoyta 1165 Glb;7(9 Kk 1):414-8) given his ESRD.  His change in mental status is likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy, but it is hard to exclude other sources of end-organ involvement such as the heart (especially considering his thrombocytosis) given his ongoing confusion.  Other sources of his confusion might include meningitis given his leukocytosis. 



1.	CV

a.	Pump

i.	Has an S3, but no signs of L or R heart failure.

ii.	Will reduce afterload prog

b.	Rhythm

i.	Sinus tachycardia, will give IVFs to reduce high-reninemic natriuretic state.

c.	Ischemia

i.	No EKG changes consistent with ischemia, will cycle cardiac biomarkers x 3, give ASA, Lipitor.

ii.	Will reduce afterload with Nitroprusside, IVFs, po anti-hypertensives.

2.	Neuro

a.	His mental status and leukocytosis are likely due to hypertensive encephalopathy but potentially concerning for possible meningitis. Will perform lumbar puncture, hold Abx since he has been in the hospital for more than 6h, give if CSF studies indicate it.

b.	Neuro following.

3.	HTN

a.	Will reduce MAP by 25% to ~100, will start with Nitroprusside, switch to Nicardipine. Will re-start some oral agents once reduced.

4.	DM1

a.	Will start half-dose of Insulin NPH, cover with RISS

5.	Renal

a.	Will need HD, will consult Renal.

6.	Thrombocytosis

a.	Stable, will consult Dr. Morgan's team re: continuing Hydroxyurea.

7.	Access

a.	L arterial line, peripheral iv.

8.	F/E/N

a.	IVFs, will start oral diet as mental status improves.

9.	Heme

a.	Has baseline anemia, likely currently hemoconcentrated, will montor Hct.

10.	Prophylaxis

a.	Senna, Colace, Nexium, Heparin.
