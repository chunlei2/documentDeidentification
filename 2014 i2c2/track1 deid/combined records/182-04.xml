History of Present Illness:  
Per Dibble General Hospital Records, the patient was admitted on 2/04/33 after collapsing in the mall.  His total time down is unclear, but the patient had an AED administered and he was shocked x2.  When EMTs arrived, they found the patient to be in VF w/ agonal breathing.  CPR was administered and he was shocked x3.  After the 3rd defibrillation, the patient awoke and was in NSR.  The patient could not recall any of the events.  

At DGH, was hemodynamically stable and did not have a recurrence of malignant arrhythmia.  His EKG showed TWI v3-v6.  His troponins went from 0.01-0.27-0.34, CK 451 w/ MB 28 (full laboratory values not available).  TTE showed depressed LV function w/ EF 30%, w/ apical apical dyskinesis.  Head CT was negative for acute process.  His mental status demonstrated slowly recovering delirium.  He was found to have a pneumonia and treated with ceftriaxone/azithromycin.  His arrhythmias were treated with amiodarone IV, transitioned to po.  He was transferred to NAMC for cardiac catheterization.

EKG SB at 57bpm, Q in v1, III/AvF, left axis, TWI in v3-v6, new from previous.  QTc 430ms (manually calculated)
CXR enlarged cardiac silhouette, L basilar opacity.

Impression/Plan: 
68yoM h/o HTN/HL, schizophrenia, medication non-compliance presents s/p VF arrest, NSTEMI, AMS.  Patient likely had ischemic VT/VF.  Per outside records, the patient does not seem to have ongoing activity of his acute coronary syndrome.  His mental status continues to be poor, and is likely multifactorial; my suspicion is that he does have some level of anoxic brain injury as the dominant pathology.

NSTEMI:  npo p MN for cardiac cath in AM.  Patient not able to consent at this point, and does not have any clear family members that can do this for him.  Will follow his mental status exam.
	-aspirin, metoprolol, lipitor, heparin IV.
	-can add ACEi when he is taking po   s and if BPs need further titration.
	-mucomyst for renal prophylaxis.
	-for risk factors, check a1c.
S/P VF ARREST: likely in the setting of NSTEMI
	-cath as above.
	-nl QTc
	-s/p amio IV load.  C/w amiodarone po load.  If reversible lesion, likely can d/c.
AMS: anoxic brain injury; current somnolence likely from narcotics.
	-appreciate neurology consultation
	-head CT
	-c/w home zyprexa.  Haldol prn.
BRONCHOSPASM: does not have significant smoking history.  ? aspiration vs cardiac wheezing
	-albuterol/ipratropium nebs standing, and prn.
	-gently diurese
	-finish course of antibiotics; ceftriaxone/azithromycin until 2/12.
CHF: mild failure
	-lasix 40iv x1.  goal TBB    500-1L
	-follow creatinine, as he apparently bumped at OSH.
U/A: check urine culture
FEN: npo while somnolent.  Otherwise, low fat/chol, no added salt.  
PROPHY:  on heparin IV.
CODE: FULL (patient cannot answer for himself)
DISPO: PT, OT, SLP eval
