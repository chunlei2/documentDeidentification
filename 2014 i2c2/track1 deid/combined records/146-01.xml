RE:  Francis, Lydia
PAH#:     981-82-02

SUBJECTIVE: Lydia has been doing well since her right total
hip arthroplasty in January of 2089.  She still has pain in
the right hip and the left hip, which is likely due to
osteoarthritis.  She has been taking Percocet for pain
control.  Fortunately, she is not having problems with
constipation, as she is taking a stool softener.  She is
taking calcitonin and Evista for her osteoporosis.  In
addition, she has had a history of right tibial
osteomyelitis and is taking prophylactic Levaquin, without
evidence of GI upset or antibiotic-associated diarrhea.  She
is taking Cozaar for her blood pressure control, and is also
taking Neurontin for pain control.  At home, she is wearing
a firm brace that Dr. Younce has prescribed.  In addition,
she is using a walker for ambulation when outside the house
and a cane when inside the house.  She comes today for her
appointment with her son.  She arrived in a wheelchair.

On examination, her blood pressure today is 138/80 with a
pulse of 80 and a respiratory rate of 16.  She is afebrile.
Cardiac exam is a regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without
murmurs.  Her neck is supple, although she does have
paracervical pain to palpation.  Her lungs are clear to
auscultation.  She has pain throughout the paraspinal
muscles in the thoracic and lumbosacral area.  She has some
pain with flexion at the hip, with limited motion at both
hips.  She has no evidence of lower extremity erythema or
edema.  Her peripheral pulses are intact.  Her patellar
reflexes are absent.  She has good pedal pulses.  She denies
depression and overall is encouraged.  She plans a trip to
Peru soon.

Medications are updated in LMR.

DISPOSITION: She will follow up with me for a complete
physical examination in November of this year, and she will
be fasting at that time.
