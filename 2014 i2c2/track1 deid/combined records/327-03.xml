CC: f/u DM, HTN



HPI: Mr. Hooper comes in for f/u on DM.  Recent bloodwork mistakenly did not include A1C.  BS have been good at home on Lantus 40 qpm.  Seeing Christine Newberry at Manamana.  



His UA had trace heme with 2-4 RBCs and 15-20 hyaline casts.  He reports h.o microscopic hematuria going back to the 2070s.  Previously saw nephrologist for this.  He reports having CT scans or u/s in the 2070s.  He reports significant FH of glomerulonephritis, and a brother with IgA nephropathy.  



He has HTN, takes lisinopril and Atenolol.

160/80 Recheck 142/90 P 66 RR 14  Wgt 267

General: obese, NAD

Extr: 2+ pedal pulses, no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema



A/P:

1. DM: HbA1C good in March.  Recheck today.  Reviewed MAlb ratio which is mildly high.  Continue lantus.    Increase Lisinopril to 30 mg qd. 

2. Hyperlipidemia: reviewed LDL which is better.  Still low HDL, consider adding Tricor or niacin.  Will discuss at next visit.

3. HTN: elevated.  Increase Lisinopril. 

4. Microscopic hematuria: he reports h/o of this since the 2070's.  Mild elevation in Cr likely rel. to HTN and DM.  However, I think he needs nephrology consult, esp. with his FH.  I have referred him to Dr. Dewitt at EDUCARE-PULLMAN.  Consider w/u for tumor causing microhematuria, though this is much less likely given the very long h/o this.  

5. f/u visit 1 month and prn.
