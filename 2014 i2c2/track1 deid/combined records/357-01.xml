paramedics.  On arrival in the Emergency Department, the patient 
was noted to be comatose, intubated, and clearly in acute distress. 
The patient has a history of diabetes mellitus.  She has had a

The chest is clear to auscultation bilaterally.  The heart has 
normal S1 and S2, no S3 or S4, and no murmur.  The abdomen is 
protuberant, but soft and non-tender, without guarding, rebound, 
masses, or organomegaly.  The extremities are grossly within normal 
limits.  Grossly, there is no posturing; there are no Babinskis; 
the reflexes are about 1+ bilaterally. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  The head CT is noted to be negative.  The 
EKG reveals ST elevations in III and possibly aVF.  The heart rate 
is approximately 130.  The chest x-ray shows proper tube placement.

negative.  The troponin I again is 2.2.  The urine toxicology is 
also noted to be negative.  The white count is 14, the hemoglobin

shows 3+ blood.  There are only 1-3 WBCs in the urine. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:   The plan is to admit the patient 
to the Intensive Care Unit for further work-up and evaluation.  An
