Attending Admission Note

HPI:  54 year old woman with h/o DM, HTN, and depression who is transferred to PSH from Missouri Baptist Hospital after being admitted from 2/15-2/20/83 and then readmitted on 2/22 with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.  She has a h/o several admisions to the hospital for abdominal pain attributed to diabetic gastroparesis.  She has had an extensive GI work-up in the past including multiple abdominal CT scans, gastric emptying study, colonoscopy, upper endoscopy, and small bowel follow through.  All studies were negative except for the gastric emptying study.  She has been treated with multiple medications, including Reglan, Ativan, Compazine, and Zelnorm without much effect.  She is currently taking Neurontin and Cymbalta to treat neuropathic pain, and her PCP started her on MS Contin in December since nothing else seemed to be helping.  The pt states that the MS Contin helped during the month of December, but then it did not seem to be working as well.  The pt is distraught over her symptoms because the pain is severe and frequent.  She has been unable to return to work for 2 years because of the pain, and she would like to be able to do so.  The pain is not necessarily related to eating.  Yesterday, she felt well and was able to eat.  Today, she was doing fine until she had to drink the gastrografin, and then it escalated to an 8/10.  She received some IV morphine, and now it is down to 4/10.
	At Missouri Baptist Hospital, her MS Contin was held, but when her BP went up, she was restarted on it.  They also started clonidine BID for her uncontrolled HTN.  It appears that a AFP level was drawn and was elevated at 11.1.  However, it is written multiple times in the transfer materials that she had an elevated CEA level of 11.1.

HISTORY:  
     S/S ABD PAIN, NAUSEA/VOM, PLS ASSESS FOR OBSTRUCTION

REPORT:
     This study was reviewed by Dr. Yee and Dr. Janssen.
     HISTORY: As provided in the header.
     COMPARISON: 10/31/2081
     TECHNIQUE:
     Contiguous axial CT scans of both the abdomen and pelvis were
     performed from the lung bases to the proximal femora to assess for
     obstruction.
     Imaging was continued into the pelvis because a charge can affect
     both cavities.
     Abdominal and pelvic images were obtained following administration
     of both oral and intravenous contrast.
     FINDINGS:
     LUNG BASES. Linear densities in the lung bases likely represents
     atelectasis.
     HEPATOBILIARY.
     Liver. The liver is normal in appearance without evidence of
     biliary ductal dilatation or focal lesion.
     Gallbladder and Bile Ducts. Patient status post cholecystectomy.
     Pancreas. Normal in appearance.
     BOWEL. There is no evidence of the obstruction or bowel wall
     thickening.  A moderate amount of stool seen in the colon and
     rectum.
     GENITOURINARY:
     Kidneys. Normal in appearance without evidence of renal calculus
     or hydronephrosis.
     Ureters and bladder. Normal in appearance.
     Adrenal glands. Normal in appearance.
     Pelvic organs. Vascular calcifications are noted the pelvis.
     PERITONEUM:No evidence of fluid collection, free air or peritoneal
     mass lesions.
     RETROPERITONEUM:
     Lymph nodes. There are a few small bilateral inguinal lymph nodes
     present without bulk.
     Vessels.  Unremarkable.
     BONES AND SOFT TISSUES. Partial sacralization of L5.
     IMPRESSION.
     No evidence of obstruction.

HISTORY:  
     GASTROPERISIS, NAUSEA AND VOMITING

REPORT:
     A gastric emptying study was performed using eggs labeled with 17
     MBq technetium 99m sulfur colloid.  There was no evidence of
     gastroesophageal reflux over 60 minutes of observation.  Gastric
     emptying was reduced, showing only 9% emptying at 60 minutes and
     29% emptying at 90 minutes.
     Impression
     Reduced gastric emptying with 29% emptying of a solid meal at 90
     minutes after ingestion.

Ordering Provider:  SHEEHAN, XIMENA

HISTORY:  
     iddm, htn, n/v and abdominal pain x 6 weeks, negative coloscopy, but
could not enter terminal ileum
assess for mass, TI thickening

REPORT:
     Image interpretation reviewed by Dr. Narvaez.
     TECHNIQUE:
     A single contrast small bowel series.
     FINDINGS:
     On small bowel follow through, the small bowel loops are normal in
     caliber and distribution. Spot compression views of the terminal
     ileum are normal. The transit time was normal.
     

IMPRESSION
     NORMAL SMALL BOWEL SERIES.
     
Assessment and Plan	
54 yo woman with DM, HTN, and depression who has had severe chronic abdominal pain x 2 years.  Extensive GI w/u has been negative except for gastric emptying study.
1.  GI: Pain is responsive to morphine.  Will continue MS contin and treat with IV morphine prn for breakthrough pain.  Gastroparesis has been a working diagnosis since all other testing has been negative.  She has other complications of DM which does put her at increased risk for autonomic dysfunction of the GI tract.  Other diagnoses to consider are bowel ischemia, although colonoscopy and CT scans in the past have not shown any changes in the bowel consistent with this diagnosis.  We will order CTA of the abdomen to rule this out.  She did have a negative anti-endomysial Ab in 2081, but I think it would be worth checking both anti-endomysial Ab and anti-gliadin Ab to r/u celiac sprue again.  We will send both an AFP and CEA levels to f/u on the unclear laboratory abnormality from Missouri Baptist Hospital.
2.  HTN:  BP is very elevated today, and this may in part be due to stopping the clonidine (which may have been given to help with GI motility).  Will continue her on her 40 mg dose of Lisinopril and 25 mg of HCTZ.  In addition, we will treat her with hydralazine until we can get the BP down.
3.  DM:  Will  treat with Insulin NPH 25 u Q am, 20 u Q pm and with sliding scale regular insulin.  Will monitor BS.
4.  Pain management:  Will continue Cymbalta and Neurontin along the the MS Contin and prn IV morphine.
