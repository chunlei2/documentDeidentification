                        OFFICE NOTE

Conner, Andrew
MR #9911852
May 18, 2071

Andy comes in for followup of hospitalization on May 6, for coronary artery disease and he had
increasing angina pectoris leading to catheterization.  He underwent angioplasty of the
circumflex vessels and then angioplasty and stenting of the first diagonal branch to the LAD. 
The latter one was done in the second setting and part of the study where the ____ the stent
versus a plain stent.  This was done by Dr. Winn, and Dr. Cook.  Since then he has been
tired, otherwise felt well.  He had reasonable lipids but low HDL syndrome.  His blood sugars
have been controlled recently with A1C's in the 6 range.  He is overweight and does not do any
regular exercise program.  He is on        for arthritis.  

His current medications consist of aspirin 325 mg per day, Plavix 75 mg per day, Glucatrol 10
mg twice daily and Glucophage 500 mg twice daily, Atenolol 25 mg daily, Nexium 20 mg per
day, Flomax .4 and Zestril. He feels well.  He is a little fatigued.  No obvious angina.  His blood
pressure is running 110/70, his pulse is running 60 and regular.  JVP is normal. Carotids are
normal.  The lungs are clear.  Coronary:  S3.

IMPRESSION:  Doing well.  I think he should probably be on Lipitor even though he is on low
lipids and I also think that he would benefit from cardiac rehabilitation. He will also pay close
attention to diabetes and he is prepared to move on with insulin.
