Date 01/18/2080 TIPTREE VASCULAR SURGERY CONSULT NOTE 
PATIENT: Massey, Ramona
MRN: 44690336
Attending: Andersen
HPI: 


The patient is a 79yF with ESRD on HD. She is being dialyzed via a right brachiocephalic fistula that was created in Nov 2075. The patient is a very poor historian and the subsequent information has been collected from the medical record. While the fistula is beng used successfully for dialysis, it has undergone aneurysmal dilatation and the patient has also developed non-healing areas over the fistula at points of access. There is note made in the chart that the patient has had difficulty with recurrent outflow stenosis and for this she seems to have undergone angioplasty at Brooks Hospital (no record in LMR) recently. The patient does not have any complaints.
