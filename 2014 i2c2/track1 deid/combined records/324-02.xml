and pain in his left leg.

a deep venous thrombosis of the left leg extending from the calf 
into the common femoral vein which is being treated now with 
Coumadin, but today he noticed the redness, swelling and pain in 
the leg.  Please see the resident's hand written record for

days of hospitalization with elevation and intravenous antibiotics.
