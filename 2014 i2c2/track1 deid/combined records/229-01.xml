He doesn't have any exertional syndrome to suggest angina.



No syncope, pre-syncope.  No palpitations, no recent weight loss.

   Continues to work.  Looking forward to Spring work in his garden.

Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Cortez is doing reasonably well.  



I think it would be reasonable to obtain a stress test because he is not significantly active, has glucose intolerance and should be periodically screened for coronary artery disease progression.



LDL goal should be 60-80 and Lipitor is increased to 20mg hs in this regard.



BP goal should be 120 systolic and Lisinopril is increased to 20mg from 10mg in this regard,.



He is strongly encouraged to pursue weightloss this Spring.



F/U 6 months.



ETT before visit.







EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, borderline left axis deviation, right bundle branch block with anteroseptal MI, no acute changes
