	Reason for visit:
   chest pain


	Interval History:
   71 yo male with HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD/CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD presents with increasing frequency of left jaw pain and chest pain for the past 4 wks. 

After his CABG, he underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD in 1/93 due to recurrent angina.  He then underwent May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until 11/94 when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He then underwent repeat cath in 12/94 which revealed in stent restenosis of prior LAD stent and was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. 

He reports complete symptomatic relief after his stent in 12/94 and he was chest pain free until about a month ago when he noted left-sided chest pain and left jaw pain that was similar to his cardiac chest pain in the past.  The pain was both exertional and non-exertional.  He also noted gradually worsening exertional dyspnea as well, though he has mostly been sedentary.  He denies any orthopnea, PND, leg edema or palpitations.  He has been compliant with all medications, including ASA and Plavix.  He is currently chest pain free.
