Patient Name: Wood, Cade

MR# 6691247

Location: BIG99

PCP:	 Dr. Otto Suzanne



Date of Admission: 8/15/92



ID/CC:	59 y.o. male with SOB during a CT on the day of admission

HPI:  Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed with stage 4 DLBCL in 11/07, S/P CHOP-R (finished 3/08), HTN, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset of SOB while lying down during a f/u staging non-contrast CT on the day of admission. Pt. notes a 5lbs weight gain over the past week. He also reports a 1-2 week h/o increasing DOE when he performs his household chores or working in his backyard. At his baseline, can can walk    of a mile w/o dyspnea or CP. 4 days PTA, he had to    take it easy    during a picnic as he would easily develop DOE with minimal exertion.  2days PTA, pt. experienced coughing bouts when he tried to lie down for sleep. The patient acutely developed SOB after lying down for a few minutes during his CT. He felt 1/10 CP during this episode located in the R middle sub-sternum. The pain lasted for approximately 10 min, dull in quality, did not radiate, did not change with position, relieved after given NTG in the ED. He experienced a similar CP during an administration of his chemo several months PTA. This CP was determined not be be cardiogenic. + diaphoresis, - N/V, - lightheadedness, - palpitations. He reports eating a lot of salty foods. - recent URI/sick contacts.

CXR:	

New mild interstitial pulmonary edema.



EKG:	Nl sinus rhythm, L axis deviation, nl intervals, T wave inversions I, aVL, T wave flattening V3-V6, old inferior infarct.



Echo 11/07 - There is symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy.  There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities.  Theestimated ejection fraction is 73 %.



___________________________________________



Impression: Pt. is a 59 y.o. male with DLBCL dx'ed 11/07 s/p CHOP-R, HTN, hyperlipidemia, GERD, and anemia who p/w acute onset SOB in the setting of a BP = 178/108 likely 2/2 flash pulmonary edema.





Plan: 

CHF - pt.'s PE resolved s/p 20 mg IV lasix, administration of lopressor, and NTG. He showed no signs of volume overload during the physical exam. Chest CT showed no acute hemorrhage, PTX, or lymphangitic spread (preliminary read). Follow-up official CT read. No contrast was given, therefore, acute SOB could not be secondary to contrast allergy. This pt.'s salty diet and uncontrolled HTN most likely led to the acute decompensation. No evidence of infection. Pt. will receive an Echo to evaluate for possible worsening LVEF s/p antrhacycline chemo vs. diastolic dysfunction with LV hypertrophy. F/U BNP. Will re-dose lasix only if necessitated by clinical signs of volume overload.

Angina - This pt. has EKG changes and pain that is possibly cardiogenic in origin. Will obtain serial enzymes to r/o MI. Begin ASA, increase lopressor to 50 TID, captopril instead of lisinopril for easier titration of BPs, 2LO2 via nasal canula. Consider stress test before d/c.

Prophylaxis - fragmin 5000 SC QD. SOB resolved after lasix + lopressor. Unlikely PE in this setting but pt. is hypercoagulable given malignancy. Low threshold for CT PE protocol.

GERD-Omeprazole.

Onc - Will check uric acid and LDH to eval. for possible TLS. Unlikely given normal electrolytes and good renal function. CT shows no lymphangitic spread but must f/u official read in the AM.
