 BMH Senior Health Initial Visit

CC: 79 yo man hx depression, psychosis, insomnia, CAD, syncope, HTN, DMT2, carotid stenosis, PVD, here for PCP and f/u of these and other chronic health problems

HPI: Patient recently presented to BMH with syncope s/p standing abruptly leading to left forhead lac. No seizure activity. He was brought to BMH where he indicated he had had 2 similar episodes in previous month. 
Concern for cardiac orig1n given lack of posterior fossa signs, orthostasis at BMH, hx of seizure symptoms, and significant trauma. He ruled out for MI, had TTE showing EF 59% but had inf. WMA and LA dilation. Cardiology was therefore consulted. An adenoMIBI stress test was later performed and revealed mild inf. lat reversible ischemia, therefore a LHCath was performed and showed moderate non-intervenable lesions in the RCA and distal PLV. The patient also underwent an EP study that was non-diagnostic. An implantable loop recorder was placed on 6/21. Other work up of syncope included CNIs showing mild RICA stenosis; neurology consult thought these findings were unlikely to be the cause of his syncope and agreed with continued evaluation of cardiac etiologies.
    
In hospital, was noted that pt had had 40 lb weight loss over previous months. Surgery was consulted regarding prompt need for intervention of a known hernia, their evaluation was that the hernia was benign without signs of obstruction and there was no need for inpatient intervention. Endocrine w/u included nl TSH and cortstim. The patient had had a recent Chest and Abd CT and colonoscopy that had no evidence of pancreatic or colonic massess. SPEP and BNP wnl and; his PSA was elevated at 9.56, however alk phos, bone survey, bone scan were all normal. The patient's nutrition and PO intake improved greatly s/p treatment for constipation with an aggressive bowel regimen. 
   
Just prior to d/c, after returning from an uncomplicated EP study the patient started to exhibit inappropriate behavior (showing stool when not requested to staff) and stating bizarre thoughts ("I lost my mortal soul"). Psychiatry was consulted and suspected the patient was having a psychotic episode in setting of prolonged
hospitalization and multiple diagnostic interventions. It was concluded that an inpatient geri-psych hospitalization was required.

Hospitalization done on Psych floor. Per psych eval, pt had been withdrawn and depressed for 8 months with poor sleep, anhedonia, and decreased energy. The pt believed that he had died some time ago and was currently in hell. He stated that he had been feeling that he had sinned so horribly, that God could not forgive him. He stated that he had died, and then further stated that by this he meant that though he might be     physically alive, because he could not be forgiven, he was for all intents and purposes, spiritually dead. He had been having vivid dreams and had been told that he had exalted himself above god and for that would be punished.
           
On the inpt ward, Mr. Shepherd was started on zyprexa 5 mg which was titrated up to a dose of 20 mg qHS. Cymbalta was initiated and titrated up to 60mg qDay with gradual and signficant improvement in his mood.  The patient also expressed difficulty sleeping which responded to Remeron 15mg. At the time of discharge, the patient reported good appetite, adequate sleep (about 8 hours a night, occasional awakening with nocturia), and significant improvement of his depression.  He further noted that his thoughts of being doomed to hell were still occasionally present, though much less intense than upon admission, and he reported that he was able to  challenge this belief "most of the time.

Neuropsych testing performed during inpt stay showing significant cognitive impairment. He had global deficits in language, memory, visual-spatial abilities, executive functioning, and attention. He had very poor learning of new information.      
     
Pt was discharged to home with an intake appointment in the Jones Hospital
Psychiatry scheduled for the following day.

He has since followed up with Frances Talley, where Zyprexa dose slowly tapered to decrease grogginess. 
 
Today, patient reports improved mood, no longer feels down, no longer feels guilty, as though in hell. Has continued to taper down Zyprexa to 3.75mg QHS. Saw Dr. Nobles on Wednesday, felt that patient should continue to stay on low dose Zyprexa for now. Pt as fell has been tapering down Cymbalta as well, taking it QOD.

Impression: 78 yo man with psychosis, depression, syncopal episodes markedly improved s/p Psych stay with psychpharm, now with weight gain. Encouraged continued intake of psych medications, continued psych f/u 

Plan:
1. Depression: Continues on Remeron and CYmbalta. Encouraged not to completely d/c Cymbalta just b/c is feeling better. Dr. Nobles to follow. Appears willing to take Remeron as he feels it helps him with sleep. I am concerned that patient feels as though his depression was "just a phase" and that his d/c'ing of medications will lead to symptom recurrence. Will reinforce this. Will call him in 1-2 wks for f/u.
2. Psychosis: no longer feels guilty, does not think he is in hell. Again, have encouraged pt not to stop Zyprexa completely. He will try to get outpt f/u at the FHV as well 
3. Insomnia: Improved vs b/l on Remeron. Goes to bed late ~3-4am and wakes at 12noon. Watches a lot of TV. This schedule not new. Encouraged going to bed earlier. 
4. Syncope: no further episodes. No pre-syncopal episodes either. Saw cardiologist yesterday, Dr. Benjamin. Event recorder just with one episode of sinus brady at 40 during sleep. Cards to continue following
5. Constipation: much improved on bowel regimen with increased fiber intake
6. Hernia: To see Dr. Small for repair of inguinal hernia
7. CAD: continue ASA, BB, ACEI. CP free. NTD for now
8. Hyperlipidemia: fasting lipid panel today
9. DM: Will get A1c today. Urine microalbumin and creatinine. Patient rarely checks blood sugars. No known retinal disease or nephropathy at this time. 
10. HTN: BP today 120/60. No changes in medication today
11. Frequency: have recommended change to Flomax from Terazosin if patient desires. Also can add Proscar. Pt will discuss with FHV physician.
