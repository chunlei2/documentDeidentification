 Patient not really able to give me any hx. Her complaint was of urinary incontinence. When I asked about the abdo pain she was not sure of any history. Denies any diarrhea, fever, dysuria, hematuria, melana.

 Patient says she takes prune juice daily for bowels to avoid constipaiton.



 Patient denied any hx of diverticultis or prior similar problems.

 Asking her about scar on hypogastruim she said was a bladder operation.

   

 Pertinent PMH:

    Is diabetic on glyburide

    Has been on prednisone for PMR, tpaering dose. Current dose per RN sheet is total 8 mg per day prednisone.

    Although mention of prior colonoscopy is made, I could not find record of results to see if known diverticuli

    A more recent colonoscopy attempt failed do to poor clean- out and patient intolerance

    Hx of chronic diarrhea



    Son reports worsening depression recently with move to the Forest Hills Center. Patient has appt with

Vital signs

BP 144/90 ,Temp 98.9 



NAD. patient able to jump off of table without pain, lively

Lungs: clear 

Cor: RR 72

Abd: soft BS normal   

        no rebound  no percussion tenderness, no guarding

        However, patient did wince in pain when I palpated LLQ. She denied was very painful though

        no masses, no h/s megly

Rectal: ? slight tender toward LLQ, no masses

           stool: heme negative



Urine  Dipstick::

-PH 7.0

DS-LEUKOCYTES NEGATIVE

UA-Protein TRACE

DS-GLUCOSE 1000

DS-KETONES NEGATIVE

DS-BLOOD NEGATIVE



Impression: Pateint appears well and has minimal physical findings (minimal pain on palp LLQ) but given

                       that she is on prednisone which may mask symptoms, as well as diabetic and dementia

                       could also obscure exam as well as history, I am concerned about acute diverticulitis.



                 I am unable to find if known diverticuli in past.



Plan:      To get Abdo/Pelvic CT now

              Will get CBC with diff, chemistries including LFT's, amylase

               Send urine for culture
