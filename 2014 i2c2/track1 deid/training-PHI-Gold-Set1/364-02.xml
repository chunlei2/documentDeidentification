Patient Name: Uribe, Walter
MRN: 4067033
Date of Admission: 8/09/2121
Attending: Thomas Wyatt
PCP: Ulisses Xuan (Santa Barbara General Hospital)
Source of History: Patient and medical record

CC/RFA: SOB, extremity edema, abdominal discomfort

HPI: This 53 yoM with a hx of morbid obesity, CHF, COPD, Diabetes and OSA reports a increase in his weight from 395 lb to 450 lb over the last 2-4 weeks. This occurred despite his efforts to lose weight and his active participation in a weight watchers weight reduction program. The weight gain was accompanied by abdominal distension and    bloating   , increased leg swelling and increasing SOB. He also reports severe DoE, with a maximal walking distance of 5-6 steps, as well as a deteriorating a scrotal edema with some dysuria, and rectal incontinence. Since the recent weight gain, he also developed an extensive itchy erythema in his groins.  He denies CP, diarrhea, HA, fever, chills, cough. His PCP prescribed metoclopramid and protonix for his abdominal complaints; however, the patient felt dizzy and dehydrated after taking these medications and decided to discontinue those. He also stopped taking his regular lasix medication about a week ago. Because of his increasing SOB, he called EMS, who found him cyanotic in his apartment with an Sa02 of 73% on RA. 

ED Course: On arrival in the ED, his VS were: T98, BP108/65, RR24, HR100, O2Sa 92% on 4L 02. He received one dose of lasix 80mg iv, urine output unrecorded. He was transferred to Internal Medicine for further management.

EKG: SR @90 BPM, low voltage, 1. degree heart block, right axis deviation

Radiology: 
CXR (portable): Low lung volumes.  Pulmonary vascular redistribution cannot be excluded on this semi upright film.
CXR (pa/lat): Mild pulmonary congestion with cardiomegaly. Small right pleural effusion. Stable elevated right hemidiaphragm.

Assessment and Plan:
53 yoM with hx of morbid obesity, CHF,  HTN, COPD, DM type 2, OSA, p/w increasing SOB and abdominal discomfort.
 
SOB: Most likely related to a combination of CHF flare (due to lasix discontinuation, BNP 1326) and COPD (PFT in 2120 indicated severe obstructive and restrictive deficit). CXR showing cardiomegaly and right-sided pleural effusion, consistent with CHF.  Started on oxygen, lasix, combivent nebs. Will reevaluate cardiac function with TTE. In the absence of CP, PE unlikely.  Cardiac enzymes negative. 
CHF: Currently treated with Verapamil for afterload reduction. Will consider to switch Verapamil to ACEI. Reinitiated Lasix. 
HTN: patient here normotensive. Currently taking verapamil, however, 1. degree heart block. Will consider switching to ACEI. 
OSA: Patient on home oxygen. Will suggest CPAP/BiPAP
Diabetes: Currently taking Glybyride, will obtain HBA1c here, keep on RISS while inpatient.
Abdominal discomfort/bloating: Most likely related to recent weight gain of 30 lbs, diabetic gastroparesis might also be contributing. Patient unable to tolerate metoclopramide. Discussed possibility of gastric bypass, patient rejects.
Rectal incontinence: Might be related to diabetic neuropathy. Patient also unable to perform anal hygiene because of obesity. 
Groin erythema: Suggestive of fungal infection. Will treat symptomatically with miconazole and obtain dermatology consult. 
RLE ulcer: Granulating leg ulcer, Will continue topical care.  
Prophylaxis: Fragmin SQ, Nexium
Code Status: Full
