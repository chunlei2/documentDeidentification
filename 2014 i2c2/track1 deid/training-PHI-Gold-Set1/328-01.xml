UA: 1.010, pH 7.0, negative dipstick; micro showed few bacteria, few squams and 0-2 WBCs 



EKG: Normal sinus rhythm. 1st degree AV block. Left axis deviation with likely left anterior fascicular block. No priors available for comparison.



Imaging:

Chest X-Ray: No evidence of pneumonia.



Hip films: Impacted, displaced fracture of the left femoral neck with longitudinal extension of fracture into the intertrochanteric proximal femur. 



TTE 6/77: Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.





Impression:

87F with PMHx of HTN, hypercholesterolemia, DM, hypothyroidism, chronic venous stasis, and h/o post-op DVT presents with L proximal femur fracture after fall. Patient&#8217;s fall does appear to be mechanical by history. Her RCRI would be Class I-II, placing her at low to intermediate risk for this intermediate risk procedure. Given that she is on beta-blockade, she should be continued with use of short acting beta-blocker (i.e., lopressor) while here in the hospital. Her chronic venous stasis change is likely due to previous bilateral DVTs based on her history. This can be evaluated postoperatively as it may affect decisions regarding potential anticoagulation.



Recommendations:

-          Please change patient from atenolol to lopressor 37.5 mg PO Q8hours, to be held for HR &lt; 55 and SBP &lt; 100

-          Please check ECG postoperatively along with troponin on Day 1 and Day 4 postoperatively

-          Please implement high risk DVT prophylaxis postoperatively with lovenox 30 mg SC BID

-          Please schedule LENIs postoperatively as is tolerated based on surgery. Would need to discuss benefits/risks of ongoing anticoagulation with family if positive



Thank you for this interesting consult. To be staffed today with Dr. Elliot Sexton.
