CCU Admit Note

Patient: Isenberg, Michael 
MRN: 3674193
Date: August 16, 2064
Attending: Dr. Kitchen
PCP: Dr. Uher

Source: Patient, and HCC records

CC: 	 SOB

HPI: 	Mr. Isenberg is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH.  He recently underwent a two vessel CABG in April 2064. At that time he had presented to HCC in CHF and w/ an NSTEMI. Cardiac catheterization revealed severe disease in the LAD and LCx territory and moderate disease in the RCA. He underwent CABG on 03/31/2064, off-pump, w/ a LIMA to the LAD graft and an SVG to the circumflex OM. His post-operative course was uncomplicated.
He presented to DSH on 8/14 w/ SOB, found to be in CHF (BNP 482). He denies any chest pain and at DSH he had no ischemic EKG changes but was found to have positive cardiac biomarker w/ an initial TnI of 0.6 rising to 23.8 o/n. His biomarkers continue to rise and on transfer were CK 745 and CK-MB of 80.3 with a fraction of 10.7%. He was transferred to HCC where he underwent cardiac catheterization that demonstrated continued severe disease in his native vessels as well as significant stenosis of his LIMA at its touch-down and complete occlusion of his SVG. A PA line and an IABP were placed and the patient was transferred to the CCU for further management.

8/15/64     NSR w/ L axis, Q   s in V1-V2 w/ 1mm ST elevations, 1mm ST depression in V5.

Assessment:
	In summary this is an 82-year-old male with a past history significant for HTN, DM, CRI, COPD, and BPH s/p a 2V CABG 4/ 2064 who presented to an OSH w/ SOB, found to be in CHF w/ an NSTEMI. Catheterization s/p transfer to HCC demonstrated diffuse native disease as well as complete occlusion of SVG and touchdown lesion of LIMA. No intervention taken w/ plan to return to Cath lab for rotor intervention on Wednesday. 
 
Plan: 
CV     Ischemia: S/p NSTEMI
Continue ASA and once PTT normalizes initiate Argatroban as some concern for HIT exists, will 
aim for goal of PTT 40-50.
Titrate up Beta-blockade and ACE-I once CHF improved. Restart Statin in AM.
Pull sheaths once PTT <60 per protocol
EKG on arrival, w/ CP and in AM
Plan for rotor intervention on Wednesday of this week
CV     Pump: presentation w/ CHF, now dry
PA line in place (but heparinized line) plan to shoot numbers and likely D/C there after
Per report w/ PCWP at 12 in Cath lab, will check BNP to have baseline.
IABP placed in Cath lab w/ some difficulty, 
CV     Rhythm - NSR
NSR at present, observe on cardiac telemetry, replete K and Mg as needed
CRI     baseline Cr 1.6-1.8
Bicarb drip and Mucomyst post catheterization
DM     FSBG QAC+HS and RISS, at home on oral therapy
Check HgbA1C
Heme - ? HIT per report, unlikely given time course
Check HIT Ab, d/c Heparin from all lines and drips
Prophy     Nexium and Argatroban
