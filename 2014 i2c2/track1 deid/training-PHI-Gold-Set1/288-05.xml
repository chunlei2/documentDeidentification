Record date: 2069-02-17

MD Connect Call 11:59pm 2/16/69 from Dr. Hale at Senior Care Clinic Queen Creek, SD regarding Terri Bird.  Patient admitted there 2/12/69 with CHF exacerbation with some associated COPD exacerbation and associated pneumonia.  All initially improved but then clinically worsening 2/14-2/16.  Patient requiring 100% NRB mask to maintain normal saturation with rising BUN/CR (hx kidney transplant).  Clinically showing pulmonary edema but no urine output to IV lasix.  Patient had established DNR status.  



Request by family to Dr. Hale to transfer patient to GCM.  I spoke to MD, nurse, and daughter-in-law and offered to accept patient when she was medically stabilized.  I thought she was too ill to safely transfer at the time without intubation before-hand.  



I called RN back at 6am and learned that patient had O2 saturation of 70%, pH=7.2 and covering MD had honored patient's established DNR order despite some family members desire to reverse it.  Patient too ill to transfer safely; will contact me again if patient stabilized.
