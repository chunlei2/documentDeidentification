CHIEF COMPLAINT.  Follow-up with regard to multiple medical problems.

SUBJECTIVE.  She begins with a very long reprise of her complaints about her 
hospitalization at Sawtelle Veterans Hospital earlier this fall.

She then follows with a long discussion of the difficulties in securing 
diabetic supplies.  Her home blood glucoses have been variable, reportedly 
due to poorly functioning glucose meter.

The Neurology Consultant has added lisinopril and Plavix to her regimen.

Had what appears to have been an injection of epidural steroids for treatment 
of symptoms referable to spinal stenosis per Dr. Jaeger, to good effect.  Her 
back pain has now begun to recrudesce, and she is considering another such 
injection.

There are multiple other somatic complaints -- neck pain; recurring nocturnal 
sweating; dry cough; runny nose; other.

MEDICATIONS.  Baby aspirin; supplements of calcium and vitamin D; Fosamax 
70 mg once weekly; prednisone 5 mg b.i.d.; folic acid 1 mg per day; 
methotrexate 15 mg per week; Celebrex 200 mg b.i.d.; Glucophage 500 mg 2 PO 
b.i.d.; Zebeta 2.5 mg per day; lisinopril 20 mg per day; Plavix 75 mg per 
day; Lipitor 10 mg t.i.w.

PMH.  Reviewed.
