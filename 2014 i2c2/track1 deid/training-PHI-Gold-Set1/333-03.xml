CC: 
 
SOB x 24-36 hrs
****************************************************


HPI: 
Ms. Edgar is a 64 y/o anxious female who presents with SOB x 24-36 hrs, mild SSCPl  and a feeling that "the fluid is coming back."  She has a long history of COPD on home oxygen, NSCLC s/p LLL resection in Oct 2121, ?CHF, and hx of PE with coumadin recently stopped. She said she felt her fluid level increase x 1.5 weeks, called her doctor who increased her lasix to 80 QDay 4 days ago and then 80BID yesterday. She thinks this is helping with the fluid but still has increased SOB at rest since yesterday afternoon. She can't remember what her PE felt like but says that this is more like fluid overload. She has a mild nonproductive cough and no hemoptysis. No fevers or sick contacts. She had SSCP today at noon that was gone in the ED but she says returned while on the floor, with no radition, no n/v/diaphoresis, no palpitations.  She said she can normally walk with a walker ~ 100 ft, but could not get up yesterday or today d/t pain.  


She has a history of multiple COPD and CHF exacerbations that have led to hospitalization.


ED Course: The patient was HR 97, BP 120/54, RR22, 98% on 4LNC in the ED, temp not recorded.  She was in mild respiratory distress and received albuterol nebulizer 2.5 mg x 1, KCl 40 meq PO x 1, Percocet 5/325 x 2 tablets.

EKG: 

Q wave in III, intermittent PACs, very low voltage.  Largely unchanged from previous - PACs may be slightly more freuqent now but were present previously.
****************************************************



Imaging:
PE-Protocol CT Scan CHEST/legs , Impression and Critical Findings:      1.No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Linear filling defect in      the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent      chronic embolus.     2.Suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins.  Evaluation of DVT      is suboptimal.  Ultrasound of the lower extremities for deep      indicated to rule out DVT clinically indicated.     3.Evaluation of pulmonary parenchyma somewhat limited respiratory      motion.  There is bilateral subsegmental atelectasis.  The patient      has undergone prior lower lobe wedge resection.
  4. There are multiple mediastinal and hilar      lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly      more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node      now measures 0.9 cm in short axis. The visualized thyroid gland      appears normal.  There are atherosclerotic vascular calcifications of      the coronary arteries.

5.      Legs: There is suboptimal opacification of the femoral veins limiting evaluation for deep venous thrombosis.  Doppler ultrasound would be      indicated to look for DVT. Significant bilateral degenerative changes      of the hips are seen.

****************************************************


Assessment:

 64F with h/o NSCLC, COPD, CHF who presents with 36 hours of increasing SOB and a feeling that "the fluid is coming back."  Has been on increasing doses on furosemide this week which has improved edema per patient but breathing is still worse today.  No other major symptoms.  



Plan:





#
 SOB
Patient presents with increasing SOB in the context of increasing ankle size and sense that she is hypervolemic.  Increased lasix has improved her fluid status but did not fully resolve her respiratory issue, which is worse today than yesterday. Differential includes CHF with fluid overload, PE, malignancy with obstructive component, PNA, or COPD exacerbation with viral infection. Increasing pulmonary hypertension a concern (h/o hypoventilation syndrome, RVH on echo, worsening dyspnea).
-Large acute PE ruled out with CT
-? of whether mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes have increased in size since previous, no other obvious progression of NSCLC, CT findings would not account for her dyspnea
-CXR and CT negative for acute PNA
-CXR and CT show mild atalectasis, possible interstitial fluid, but show no effusions or other significant signs of fluid overload.  BNP is not very high.  However, patient has poor PFTs and small change in volume status may tip her into respiratory distress.  Cough c/w increased volume or viral infection
-Plan is to continue with diuresis as volume overload is most likely explanation of her respiratory status, furosemide 80 mg BID with PRN lasix as needed to maintain fluid status -500-1.0 L tomorrow.  Avoiding more aggressive diuresis as she has a history of over-diuesis with ARF.


-Continue home Tiotropium, Albuterol, Fluticasone Prop/Salmeterol 500/50 (Advair Diskus 500/50) 


#
 NSCLC
Likely not the cause of tonight's presentation with acute SOB, although chest CT must be re-evaluated for possible evidence of cancer.  Mild or no increased size of mediastinal lymph nodes may be concerning.  
-F/U with Dr. Lacey in AM, patient wants all information regarding imaging results and prognosis directly from Dr. Lacey
-Appt already scheduled for July 13th with Dr. Lacey for f/u


#Anxiety/Depression
Patient prescribed clonazepam 0.25 BID but is taking it 0.25 in AM, 0.25 in PM, and additional 0.5 QHS for significant anxiety.  Additionally takes seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine.  Patient is very anxious on exam with intermittent crying, fearful expression.
-Continue on home regimen Seroquel, pregabalin, fluoxetine
-Clonazepam  0.25 QAM, 0.5 mg QHS, 0.25 daily PRN while in house


#Cardiac: Continue with home meds, will diurese as above for possible CHF exacerbation
 -Continue ASA, metoprolol, furosemide, simvastatin  


#DM
Home regimen is 70/30 50 units BID and Levemir 40-50 units QHS, titrated to sugars. Lowered totalo dose of insulin to 100 (70% of home dose), distibuted between basal and mealtime insulin, with additional sliding scale
-Continue to up-titrate insulin 


#Chronic Back Pain
-Continue percocet and lidocaine patches PRN.


Other Chronic issues (GERD, endometriasl hyperplasia, skin care)
-Continue meds as described in medication section



#Care Providers: Dr. Lacey (Surg Onc), Dr. Arthur Qin (PCP), Daughter Xiang 045-200-7477


#
 Presumed Full Code: Code needs to be discussed with patient in the morning; due to patient's significant anxiety, the discussion was not appropriate at this time. Patient said she was too anxious to discuss her medical problems or possible treatment.


#Dispo: Pending.  Patient lives at home but has been in rehab previously.  Daughter is Xiang, 045-200-7477, who lives with and takes care of her mother.


-- 
I have discussed this patient with Dr. Baby Le.

CHEST CT: 

No evidence of acute pulmonary embolism.  Linear filling defect in the apical segmental artery of the left upper lobe could represent chronic embolus. S/P LLL resection.

Note: There are multiple mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, which are some centimeters in size.  They are slightly more prominent than in the previous exam.  The right hilar lymph node now measures 0.9 cm (1.5 cm upon wet read) in short axis. 





IMPRESSION AND PLAN


64 YOF w/ a PMHx of NSCLC

, diastolic CHF, remote PE that presents w/ shortness of breath for the past 1-2 days and SSCP prior to admission. Mild cough, non-productive but denies fevers/chills. Of note, PFTs showed obstructive defect FEV1/FVC 65% w/ FEV1 44% w/ low DLCO/VA 53% concerning for severe COPD w/ loss of alveolocapillary units but DLCO seems



# SHORTNESS OF BREATH. Multifactorial.
-Concern for worsening pulmonary HTN.  
Note there was a large PA, RVSP unable to be determined on ECHO but RVH w/ mulitple etiologies that could contribute to pulmonary HTN (chronic PEs, L sided CHF). Needs pulmonary HTN w/u w/ RHC. Will contact Dr. Quant.
-

NSCLC. Pt had a T1N0Mx adenocarcinoma resected 10/2121 and followed by Dr. Quentin Lacey from thoracic surgery. Chest CT appears stable from 3/27/2123 but will have him review given the one LN is .9-1.5 cm - will ask if it is amenable to biopsy.
-Diastolic CHF - normal TTE (LVEF 76%, No WMAs.) w/ 2-3+ pitting edema. BNP 423. Diurese until Cr increases. Goal TBB -1L. Will f/u on lasix 80 mg PO BID. 

-Morbid obesity w/ obesity hypoventilation syndrome continue on BiPAP

-Hx of PE. Will f/u w/ radiology re: chronic nature of PE 

-COPD &#8211; on 2-2.5L home O2. Diffuse emphysema. Standing nebs. VBG before BiPAP



# DM II - last A1c 5.1 on 2/13. Switch to Lantus/Aspart while in hospital b/c we do not have 70/30.
# HYPOTHYROIDISM. 
Will try and determine why pt was increased to 175 mcg Levothyroxine w/ TSH of 5 in May 2123. 




Appreciate the excellent care of her resident PCP and will e-mail Dr. Arthur Qin that she is in the hospital. Rest as above.
