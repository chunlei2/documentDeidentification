Patient Name:	Nathan Rico			

MRN:  9190908

Date:	10/20/69			



ID/CC:  49 year-old right-handed man presenting with left hemiparesis and hemineglect.



HPI: This pt has a past medical history significant for hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus type 2. Per his wife, in April he described left hand weakness. He stopped smoking at the time and stated that his deficit resolved. He was in his usual state of health until this evening. He last noted feeling normal after the Coyotes game, which ended at about 7:30PM. He subsequently took a nap, per his routine, and awoke at 11:00PM to ready himself for his night shift as an RN. He took a shower and noted weakness in his right arm during the shower. After, while trying to put his clothes on, he developed progressive weakness such that his arm became plegic and he was no longer able to stand. EMS was phoned and the pt arrived at the GBH ED around 11:40PM. NIH stroke scale = 12 . Pt went for CT/CTA and required sedation and intubation to tolerate scan.

DIFFERENTIAL REQUEST   RECEIVED



Imaging: CT/CTA: old right parietal infarction; occluded right internal carotid artery; thrombus in right middle cerebral artery.



EKG: NSR, 68, LAD, no ST/T changes.



Impression: 49 year-old right-handed man presenting with right MCA-distribution stroke. He has a prior right parietal stroke apparent by CT scan and an occluded right internal carotid artery. Artery-to-artery embolus from the right ICA to the right MCA represents a likely etiology for stroke in this patient.



Recommendations:

1.	Admit to CMF neurology

2.	MRI with diffusion to assess distribution of stroke and whether diffusion/perfusion mismatch is present.

3.	allow blood pressure to autoregulate, with approximate SBP goal 140-180. When scanning done, pt should be extubated and exam followed, correlated with blood pressure.

4.	consider heparin if territory of infarct is not so large as to render hemorrhage into infarction too great a risk.
