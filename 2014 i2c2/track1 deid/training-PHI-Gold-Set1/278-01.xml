Plan	

#1 CAD- 70 yo ruling in for MI s/p LAD intervention

-Ischemia- angina resolved with nitrates, reviewed EKG with Dr. Espinosa (in to examine pt) and discussed with Dr. Espinosa and Jessup, will keep sheaths in overnight, restart Hep no bolus when PTT down, con't Integrelin, ASA/Plavix (initiate Zantac prophylaxis and guiaic stools), NPO after midnight in case relook indicated, con't IV TNG 

-Pump- will obtain echo (no LV gram done), monitor I/O, diurese if CHF sx (sat lowish but no JVD/crackles, ?baseline pulm dz), con't post cath hydration and check creat in AM (375 cc dye), consider initiating Ace-I, hold on Ibuprofen for now

-Rhythm- suboptimal rate control, con't Lopressor 25 mg qid- change to bid dosing once tolerance better evaluated, watch for wheeze or ectopy



#2 DM- Accucheck bid, check HGbA1c, resume Glipizide in AM (unless relook cath), initiate Lipitor for LDL 126; defer PT/dietary consults for now



#3 ID- low grade temp and mild WBC elevation on admission, will check UA now, CXR in AM, initiate Ancef while sheaths in



#4 Neuro- transient confusion and ?visual halluc prob due to benzos/narcotics, neuro exam nonfocal, will maintain freq observation for pt safety, esp given sheaths overnight
