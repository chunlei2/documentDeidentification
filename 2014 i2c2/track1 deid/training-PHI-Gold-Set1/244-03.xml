Narrative History

Pt reutrns for f/u.

She has not been taking lipitor for several weeks as ran out and did not refull Rx. 

She has had R shoulder pain for about one month. Pain is an aching quality, minimally alleviated by tylenol, exacerbated by moving rotating shoulder. Does not have frozen shoulder or sensation of morning stiffness. She is able to continue all IADL activities requiring use of the joint but notes the pain has become increasingly bothersome. She notes no weakness of her R arm, no dysesthesias or paresthesias, swelling, or history of injury. 

She has noted burning pain in lower extremities, stocking distribution x 1 year. She has pain described as "pins" from bottom of foot extending up both legs. She has a burning sensation of both legs that she notices particularly at night. Walking does not exacerbate or alleviate this sensation. She has not used anything to relieve the discomfort. She has no symptoms of claudication, no reported cyanosis of her LE digits, and no LE edema.

Assessment and Plan

1. Shoulder pain.

Impingement sign, pain with cross over manouver, and pain with use of shoulder to extend arm are consistent with rotator cuff injury. 

Check shoulder films to exclude acromioclavicular injury or degenerative process.

Renew Vioxx prescription (avoiding NSAIDs) in this patient on prednisone, at risk for gastritis.

2. CAD.

Pt had negative stress MIBI in 12/91 and has not had cardiology follow up for multiple years. She is being referred to the Internal Medicine ward service for consultation. Specifically, she remains on a nitrate (isordil) which may exacerbate GERD. She also merits being placed on an ACE inhibitor to prevent reinfarction.

She is well beta blocked and her BP is well controlled by the current regimen of atneolol and isordil.

Checking fasting lipids.

3. SLE.

She is being followed by Dr. Xie.

She and I are curious about her prednisone dosing and I will discuss the regimen with Dr. Xie. 

4. Prednisone.

Had BD of hip last year which was negative; continues on calcium/vitamin D.

Needs further monitoring of HgbA1C as elevated from prior measurements and hyperglycemic from steroids.

5. Mammogram.

Ordered this visit for routine HCM.

6. Pain control.

She has multiple complaints of chronic pain which are not documented in this note. She has used Vioxx previously and needs Stuart Hospital authorization which is being sought following this visit.

7. GERD. 

Well-controlled with new regimen of Protonix 40 BID.

8. LE dysesthesias.

Remeasuring A1C but unlikely to have microvascular complications without overt DM.

Starting amitriptyline. Pt educated to take prior to sleep and will reassess if sx alleviated.

9. F/u.

Pt will follow up with me in 3-4 months.

 John V. Hood, M.D.



Attending note:

Pt seen and discussed with Dr. Hood, and agree with his evaluation and plan.

Pt with symptoms and signs of impingement syndrome due to rotator cuff tendinitis vs partial tear, and also tenderness and positive cross-over test c/w A-C arthritis. Will check X-ray, get PA for Vioxx, and would benefit from PT referral. If no improvement, consider MRI vs empiric subacromial/?A-C joint steroid injection.

Seems to have a painful peripheral neuropathy, cause uncertain. Will try low-dose TCA, would also check B12, consider EMG/NCV.

Will obtain cardiology review for CAD. Regardless of level of lipids, there is evidence for benefit of statin, and would encourage pt to resume. If current chest pain syndrome more likely due to GERD than ischemia, could consider D/C nitrates.
