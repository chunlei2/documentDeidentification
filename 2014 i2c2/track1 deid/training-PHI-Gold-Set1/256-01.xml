Neurology ED Consult Note



Patient: Klein, Michelle

MRN:	2474410

Date: 	2/6/50

Time: 	10:00 p.m.

PCP:	Whitney Keller, M.D.



Reason for consult: garbled speech



HPI:   Patient is a 74 yo RH woman with history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, CAD s/p LAD stent (2144) who was in her USOH until this afternoon at 12:15 p.m. when she experienced sudden onset of garbled speech and difficulty "expressing myself" while cooking lunch for she and her husband.  This episode was accompanied shortly thereafter by a dull, L fronto-temporal headache that persisted for several hours.  She states she did not have word-finding difficulties but simply had trouble articulating herself.   The episode came on suddenly and lasted 1-2 hours before she resolved back to baseline.  In addition to headache, associated symptoms included generalized weakness, feeling cold and mildly nauseated.  She denied visual changes, chest pain, sob, palpitations, lightheadedness, vertigo, difficulty with swallowing, coordination or gait.  She describes having a glass of orange juice with the thought that her sugar might be low, without apparent effect.



She recalls one similar episode ~ 2 years ago at which time she had her husband drive her home and she went to bed.  The speech difficulty had resolved by morning, and she apparently never told her physician or had any further work-up.  She has no known history of seizures.  Migraines occur 1-2x/year, preceeded by scintillating scotoma, associated with nausea, photophobia, relieved by sleep.  No recent fevers, chills,  weight loss or weight gain, cough, abd pain, diarrhea.  Reports regular exercise including this morning (stationary bicycle).
