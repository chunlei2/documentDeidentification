Micro: Blood culture pending
Urine culture pending
Abdominal wound cx pending


Studies:  CXR:  Lung fields clear, no evidence of pneumonia. 


CT abd/pelvis:There is mild inflammatory fat stranding, heterogeneity, and slightly increased vascularity involving the anterior abdominal wall, extending in to the scrotum without evidence of drainable fluid collection or air pockets. Mild induration and thickening of the overlying skin of the abdominal wall is also noted. Stable postsurgical scar in the right anterior abdominal wall. Surgical sutures in the anterior abdominal wall. There is a superficial soft tissue mass in the subcutaneous tissue of the left anterior abdominal wall, slightly larger on the current study measuring approximately 3.3 cm. There are mild degenerative changes involving the thoracic and lumbar spine.


Procedure note: The area of induration on the left side of the patient&#8217;s pannus was prepped with betadine. 5cc of 1% lidocaine without epinephrine was infiltrated into the area. A 2cm incision was made over the area of fluctuance and approximately 8cc of purulent thick fluid was expressed. A culture of the abscess fluid was sent. The wound was probed gently to break up any loculations. The wound was then packed with &#188; inch dry packing tape. A dry sterile dressing was applied. The patient tolerated the procedure well. 


Impression/Plan: 33 year old diabetic male with history of Fournier&#8217;s gangrene s/p multiple debridements and diverting colostomy presents with recurrent cellulitis and abscess of the left side of his pannus. The abscess was drained and packed in the ED. The patient will be admitted for IV antibiotics and careful monitoring of his cellulitis.
-          Admit to Langmack Hospital Surgery, Senior Resident: Dr. Imani Blevins
-          BID wound packing
-          Linezolid/Cefepime/Flagyl (prior abscess cultures: pseudomonas sensitive to linezolid, klebsiella sensitive to cefepime)
-          Follow up wound culture
-          Serial exams with careful monitoring for spread of cellulitis.
