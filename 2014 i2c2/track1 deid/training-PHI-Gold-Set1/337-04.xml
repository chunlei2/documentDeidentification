ED Neurology Consult Note

August 01, 2087

Time of Exam: 3:15 AM



PATIENT: Gillis, Betty

MRN: 8308652



CC: L arm numbness



HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar strokes who presents with L arm numbness. Patient was sitting on her couch this morning between 9-10 AM when she began to have L arm numbness. She initially thought it was from leaning on her arm but it did not improve when she moved. She also noted that it was not in any particular nerve distribution. Aside from this deficit, she denies any H/A, LOC, dizziness, blurry vision, facial droop, weakness, or aphasia. Her symptoms persisted for about 12 hours and then spontaneously resolved. Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.

RADIOLOGY/STUDIES:

     1.  Scattered punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that are not

     well evaluated on ADC or exponential images, in the right MCA/PCA

     border zone distribution.  Given the pattern of signal

     abnormality, these most likely represent subacute infarcts, with

     possible subacute on chronic right posterior corona radiata

     infarct.

     

     2.  Evidence of prior right MCA territory infarct and chronic

     small vessel ischemic disease.

     

     3.  No hemodynamically significant stenosis of the extracranial or

     intracranial circulation.



ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

75 yo woman with a history of stroke, HTN who presents with L arm numbness. While her deficits appear to have resolved, arguing against stroke, she clearly has multiple punctate foci of DWI hyperintensity that would be consistent with acute stroke. These strokes are in the PCA region and at the watershed region of the MCA/PCA and so could represent both anterior and posterior circulation emboli. Given that her carotid arteries are relatively clear, her heart or arch may be possible sources of embolus.

- Has had stroke workup in the past that has been unrevealing

- Would benefit from a repeat echocardiogram to assess for any new vegetations or thrombi

- Would also benefit from repeat Holter to assess for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation

- Admit to Internal Medicine service
