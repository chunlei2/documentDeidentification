ECG:  NSR, nil acute, unchanged from previous 05/05/64    

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
44M with ESRD on HD presents with N/V.  His symptoms appear to be resolving and this may represent a viral gastroenteritis, as his cardiac enzymes are negative and sugars have been well-controlled since presentation to ED.  He may have an element of diabetic gastroparesis given his medication list.  We will add amylase and lipase to his bloodwork to r/o pancreatitis.  Consider AXR to r/o constipation (normally on lactulose).

Plan:
1.  HD today as per usual schedule and prescription.  Hold Epo given Hct elevated.
2.  Will draw blood Cx x 2, iron studies, 25OH Vitamin D, PTH in HD.
3.  Start Nephrocaps.
4.  CAD risk:  Start ASA 81mg qd.
5.  Polypharmacy:  On multiple antihypertensives at different doses.  Would d/c enalapril and losartan.  Use only lisinopril daily (titrate up as needed), but ask patient to take meds after dialysis on dialysis days.
6.  Social work to see (already informed).
