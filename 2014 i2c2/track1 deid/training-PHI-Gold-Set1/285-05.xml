EDVISIT^28297534^OGRADY, MICHAEL^03/16/98^OCASIO, GEORGE OJAS

I saw this patient with resident Dr. Elijah Parker.  Please see

his note for further details.  I confirm that I have interviewed

and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation

on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of

care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 69-year-old male

with a history of hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery

disease, previous MI, and esophageal cancer with mets to lung,

status post VATS, and a recent hemothorax and chest tube.  He was

discharged 2 days ago, now presenting with increasing cough.  He

had been seen in an outside hospital earlier today and diagnosed

with a right lower lobe pneumonia.  He was also given 1 g of

ceftriaxone.  His complaints prior to presentation had been chest

pain as well as shortness of breath, abdominal discomfort, and

palpitations.  On reviewing his chart, he had had his diltiazem

and Lopressor discontinued on his last admission.  Other systems

were reviewed and found to be negative including fevers, chills,

hemoptysis, or difficulty swallowing.

MEDICATIONS:  Reviewed.  Please see the chart.  He is currently

on aspirin and took today.

ALLERGIES:  IV dye and Neurontin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake, alert, but cachectic

appearing, and nontoxic.  Temperature 98, pulse of 111,

respirations 20, blood pressure 104/61, and oxygen saturations

are 95%, however, this is on 5 liters.  HEENT exam:  Mucosal

membranes are dry.  Neck is supple without lymphadenopathy. 

Lungs:  Crackles at the right lung.  Left lung is clear.  CVS: 

Tachycardic but regular.  Abdomen:  There is some mild diffuse

tenderness in the upper quadrants, no rebound or guarding, and no

Murphy's.  He has normoactive bowel sounds.  Skin is warm and

dry.  Back is nontender at CVA points.  He has got bilateral

lower extremity edema, but no tenderness in the thighs and

calves.  Neurologically, he is somewhat somnolent, but oriented

without focal motor or sensory deficits.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is elevated at 19,300, 90% polys, 2

bands.  Chemistries are normally slightly perhaps more dehydrated

with creatinine of 1.3, which is a little above his baseline of

1.2 when he was discharged.  LFTs are all normal including lipase

and total bilirubin; however, his alkaline phosphatase is mildly

elevated.  First set of cardiac enzymes is negative.  EKG shows a

sinus tachycardia with PVCs and nonspecific inferior ST-T wave

changes.  Chest x-ray shows bilateral basilar nodules, which have

been there in the past.  There is a hazy opacity in the right mid

hemithorax, which does not look new, however, this could

represent tumor versus pneumonia.  However, no significant change

prior to his discharge.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Given his dyspnea and his elevated

white count, this case was discussed with Oncology.  He was

admitted for dyspnea, ruling out pneumonia.  He is in stable

condition.
