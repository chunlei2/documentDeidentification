Impression and Plan

Mr Albert has progressive renal insufficiency, he does currently not require renal replacement therapy. Contributors may be Cyclosporine toxicity and intermittent dehydration. However, the recent more rapid rise makes biphosphonate toxicity or HCV-associated renal disease a worthy consideration. Bobbie also has uncontrolled hypertension and anemia.



I took the liberty to order a 24-hour urine collection, a kidney US, as well as SPEP, UPEP, cryoglobulin level, Fe-studies. Norvasc 5mg PO qd was also returned to his regiment. For now, I suggest to hold further infusions of Parmidronate until more data is available.



Bobbie will have a blood pressure check in 2 weeks (when he is in Nappanee for another appointment), and I will see him in four weeks. At that point he will be evaluated for Epogen/Aranesp.
