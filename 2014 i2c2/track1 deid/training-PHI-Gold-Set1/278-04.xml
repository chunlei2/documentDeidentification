ID/CC:75 YO M with chest pain 	







HPI: 

This pleasant 75 YO M presents today after multiple episodes of sharp L anterior chest pain. The first episode started this AM (10AM). It was left sided with out radiation non positional or pleuritic. Denies any associated sx such as palpitations, SOB, n,v. Although he has had a mild cough with throat irratation over the past few days.  He was attributing this pain to gas but he took an aspirin and (expired) nitroglycerine SL just in case. He had an anteroseptal MI in 2092 and when questioned he does not feel this pain is similar to his prior attack.  Later that day he had another episode of pain for which he felt more worried about, called the EMS for evaluation of a cardiac cause of his pain. On route to the Hospital the EMS gave SL nitro which relieved the pain. He was evaluated in the ED where he had EKG, cardiac enzymes and was given his normal dose of beta blocker. His EKG when compared showed evidence of his old anterior septal MI, possibly slightly inverted T waves in I,AVL and deeper T wave  inversions in V1-3. 

First 2 sets of cardiac enzymes have been normal and he has remained CP free since the last nitro.

__________________________________________



Impression:



75 YOM with CP here for ROMI. Pt is CP free as of arrival to ED will contiue to RO and likely stress in the AM. Pt cardiac risk factors included age, prior history, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, DM.

Plan: 



1.Chest Pain- 

-ROMI enzymes cycled, EKG serial, ASA, BB, Nitro as needed

-Bruce protocol stress in the AM if enzymes rule out

-On cardiac telemetry



2. DM- On RISS

-Will check Hba1c



3.Prx nexium, fragmin
