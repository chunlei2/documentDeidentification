EDVISIT^10776605^Glenn, Olivia^01/14/80^WOODRUFF, FERNE

I saw this patient in conjunction with Dr. Leyva and Dr.

Forrest.  I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the

patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's

chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 65-year-old female with difficulty breathing.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known multiple

medical problems presents with difficulty breathing.  At her

rehabilitation facility was noted to be hypoxic and thus was sent

here.  The patient's recent past medical history is remarkable

for a fall with cervical fractures, rib fractures, and subsequent

hemothorax for which she was admitted to the Educare-Pullman ICU over the

end of December through the beginning of January.  The patient's

chest tube was withdrawn approximately 10 days ago and the

patient has been doing well at rehab since.  However, today was

noted to have desaturations to 80% on room air.  She had

shortness of breath as well.  Her oxygen saturations improved

marginally on oxygenation and have been responsive to

nonrebreather treatment in the transport here.  The patient was

treated with nebulizers and Lasix without significant improvement

and is noted to be quite tachypneic.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable for hypertension, CHF,

diabetes, asthma, chronic renal insufficiency, osteoporosis,

anemia, and cervical fracture.

SOCIAL HISTORY, FAMILY HISTORY, AND REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Limited

by the severity of the patient's presentation.

MEDICATIONS:  Insulin, Zocor, PhosLo, calcium carbonate,

Protonix, Niferex, Norvasc, Fosamax, Epogen, Lasix, lisinopril,

Colace, and Xalatan.

ALLERGIES:  Morphine and aspirin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in some

degree of respiratory distress, however, able to interact and

answer questions in 1-2 word sentences.  Vital signs are as

documented with an elevated blood pressure of 176/96, pulse 76,

and oxygen saturation is 98% on nonrebreather.  HEENT exam is

atraumatic, normal to inspection.  The patient has a large tongue

and her uvula is not visible at all.  Neck is immobilized in a

C-collar and is obese.  Respiratory exam reveals decreased breath

sounds diffusely with tachypnea and respiratory muscle accessory

use.  Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm without

murmur.  Pulses are palpable in all four extremities.  Abdomen is

soft and nontender, obese, but without any organomegaly or

masses, or guarding, or rebound.  Skin is intact, warm, and dry

without any lesions or rash.  Musculoskeletal exam reveals

tenderness over the right ribs where the patient has known rib

fractures.  Neurologically, she is oriented with difficulty

speaking due to respiratory distress but no focal neurologic

deficit.

LABORATORY STUDIES:  BNP is elevated in the 500-600 range.  White

blood count is slightly elevated at 10, hematocrit 26.3, which is

at the patient's baseline, and creatinine of 2.2.  LFTs within

normal limit.  INR 1.2.  D-dimer significantly elevated.  EKG

demonstrates sinus rhythm with nonspecific ST-T wave changes.

IMAGING STUDIES:  Chest x-ray shows bilateral effusions, which

are present previously but possibly slightly increased.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was initially given

Lasix and nitro with improvement in her blood pressure and was

also started on CPAP.  She seemed to be improving clinically for

some period of time but then began to decline in her mental

status.  At that time an ABG was sent demonstrating hypoxia. 

Prior to those results, the decision was made that the patient

likely needed intubation.  We had hope to hold off to do a

thoracentesis; however, the patient's clinical course declines

such that it was not possible for her to sit up for the

procedure.  On CPAP, the patient's oxygen saturations were stable

throughout in the 90s, but she developed increasing respiratory

distress.  Intubation was complicated by her inability to flex

her neck, her large tongue, and her body habitus; was successful

in two attempts with one episode of bag mask ventilation in

between those attempts.  For full details of the procedure,

please see the attached procedure note.  Thoracic Surgery was

consulted.  They arrived as the patient was being intubated.  At

this time their recommendation is for a CT scan of the chest to

determine whether this is more likely a hemothorax or a pleural

effusion and whether it is loculated.  This study will be

performed and then patient will be admitted to her ready bed in

the ICU.  A bedside ultrasound was also performed by myself and

the resident demonstrating no obvious pericardial effusion.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Bilateral pleural effusions.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Respiratory distress.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Question recurrent hemothorax versus pleural

effusion.

FOURTH DIAGNOSIS:  Question CHF.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted to the ICU.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  75 minutes.
