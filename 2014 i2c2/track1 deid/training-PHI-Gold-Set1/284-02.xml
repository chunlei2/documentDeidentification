Ridgewood Hospital Intern Admission Note

	



CC  Chest pain



HPI

78 yo F with PMHx sig for CHF, HTN, atrial fibrillation (cardioverted 2/68, now on amiodarone), and DM p/w increased SOB and chest pain over 1 weeks time.  Symptoms not related to exertion and reports sternal area is the location of pain.  Occurs at rest. Feels like pressure and at times sharp pain, not related to respiration. 7/10 when maximal intensity.  Pain is constant in nature, patient states lasting up to hours at a time.  No specific provocative or palliative factors.  Not related to position.  Reports that SOB and chest pain are chronic problems for her and the reason she presented to the ED is because the symptoms have increased over the past week.



No associated symptoms of N/V or diaphoresis.  Reports occasional palpitations.  Patient also feels pain in her back, shoulders, and arms which she attributes to her arthritis and not radiation of the pain.  States that she sleeps on 4 pillows and this does represent on acute change.



Denies fever/chills.  Reports constipation at baseline (BMs do not occur everyday). Patient states she has    frequent sinus infections.   



PMHx

HTN, CHF (good systolic function though), Afib (past cardioversion Feb. 2068),

DM

Pulmonary embolism - bilateral, treated at Buzan County Clinic (CT with multiple filling defects in LLL, RUL, RLL c/w PE), non-Q wave MI with inferolateral apical depressoins at Buzan County Clinic 6/69; RSH admission 5/17/70 with D-dimer=1976, CT negative for PE and DVT

Osteoarthritis, anxiety, depression with psychotic features, lumbar disc disease (s/p surgical repairs), 

Echo: 5/21/70: The left ventricular systolic function within normal limits.  There is segmental left ventricular dysfunction which involves the inferior territory, this has deceased sine 12/68 study. The estimated ejection fraction is 57%. Estimated RV systolic pressure is 89 mmHg. Right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits.



Stress The ECG response to pharmacological stress was  uninterpretable for ischemia. The myocardial scans are within normal limits and do not demonstrate evidence of myocardial ischemia or infarction. Region(s) with apparent reduction in tracer activity likely reflect soft tissue attenuation, not specific for coronary artery disease. LVEF=64%.





PE protocol CT 5/70: no evidence of pulmonary embolism. Delayed venogram of the pelvis and lower extremities demonstrates no evidence of of DVT.

A 2.2 x 1.4 cm nodule is identified on image 112 in the right upper lobe.  In addition, there is ground glass opacity involving the bilateral lungs.  There is interstitial pulmonary edema and a small right pleural effusion.

5/23 Chest CT: previously demonstrated nodule in the right upper lung measuring 17 mm x 11 mm has resolved.

Assessment and Plan



78F h/o CHF (diastolic dysfunction), Afib (s/p cardioversion), HTN, DM, past b/l PE presents with increased CP and SOB times week. Differential includes CHF exacerbation (? Setting of med noncompliance), ACS, PE.



1)PE - D-dimer is 2257; Heparin 6000 unit bolus, 1000 unit/hr with sliding scale; PE protocol CT;

Continue to hold Metformin, received 600mg Mucomyst in preparation for dye load and continue 2 doses post scan; Preliminary CT read: no evidence of PE although limited by motion artifact; ground glass changes c/w with CHF; Continue Heparin as pt. with h/o PE and awaiting final CT read.



2) r/o MI - Enzymes negative x2; ASA, O2; B-blocker continued (no evidence of systolic dysfunction); Received ACE (Zestril x1), now hold in setting of dye load



3) CHF - strict I&Os, daily weight, no salt diet; exam reveals slight fluid overload, after initial diuresis (Lasix 20 IV x2) will hold in light of CT w contrast, monitor fluid status, no IVF at this time



4) DM - hold Metformin, on Insulin SS with bid coverage



5) Urine - negative nitrite/WBC, sediment 5-10 WBCs, few bacteria; Likely asymptomatic bacteruria in elderly patient, afebrile, no increased WBC, therefore no treatment at this time.

 

Prophylaxis: 

-- Nexium



Dispo: 

-- Ambulate, PT/OT



Code: 

-- Unknown
