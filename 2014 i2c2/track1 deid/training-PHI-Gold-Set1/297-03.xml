Fayetteville, MI  31474                             94859580

HPI:  Mr. Vicente returns for follow-up.  He is status post TURP by Dr. 
Nixon.  He is having a little bit of incontinence, but Dr. Nixon 
thinks that this should get better.
 
We will have to recheck his platelets, which have been in the 120 to 145 
range.  We also will look back at his echocardiogram, which is showing 
that he had slight mitral and tricuspid regurgitation as well as mildly 
dilated LV with inferior hypokinesis.  He has remained on digoxin status 
post his myocardial infarction.
 
We want to recheck his cholesterol today.  We also have been concerned 
that he has been a little depressed but mostly because he is concerned 
about his wife's situation with breast cancer.  We had a long discussion 
about this.
 
Physical Examination:  On physical examination, his weight is 250 lbs.  
His blood pressure was 178/80.  The follow-up was 170/80.  His neck was 
supple.  Chest was clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac 
exam was regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen 
was soft and nontender with no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities were 
clear of cyanosis, clubbing or edema.  Rectal tone was normal and guaiac 
negative.
 
Laboratory Data:  His hematocrit was 39.9.  Platelets were within normal 
limits.  White count is 8.3.  Digoxin is 0.9.  Lytes are within normal 
limits.  
 
Assessment and Plan:
1.   Status post TURP.  He appears to be recovering well.  He has had 
     slight incontinence, but I suspect this will pass.
2.   Thrombocytopenia.  This was very relative.  It now appears to have 
     resolved.
3.   Coronary artery disease.  As he recovers from his TURP, I question 
     whether it might be reasonable to go ahead and reexercise him.  At 
     the present time, he is quite stable on an aspirin, digoxin and 
     Lasix.  However, it may be that he would benefit from further 
     treatment with anti-anginals.
4.   Hypercholesterolemia.  This has been well-controlled recently.  His 
     last cholesterol was 168 in August of 2093.
5.   Depression.  He continues on Ambien.  He has some discretion about 
     his wife's breast cancer, and he appears to have some of his 
     uncertainty resolved.
