1.  Health Maintenance - Pap smear with gyn soon, mammo - very overdue - stressed needs to do this again and promises, Stool cards. Declined sig for now but promises to think about it.

2. Menopause - calcium, consider BD when not overwhelmed with everything else - much prefer she concentrate on the appts, Pap smear and mammo.

  

Rest of issues - see above.
