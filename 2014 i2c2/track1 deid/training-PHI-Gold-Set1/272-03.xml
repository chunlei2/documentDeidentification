4.  GERD.  Recently started on a proton pump inhibitor for chronic symptoms of heartburn type pain.



There were some confusion regarding patients medications as he gets many of his medications from the ANRC and I had been on aware of some of the medication changes that have been made recently.  Has stated above no longer on verapamil but now on amlodipine, changed to simvastatin.  He brought in a list of all his medications and dosage adjustments were made to the LMR medication list.
