ID/CC  30 year old with ESRD/HD with facial swelling 

HPI:     This patient presented to the ED with a 1 day h/o facial swelling.  She also reports diffuse abdominal pain x several days; as well as chills at dialysis on Wednesday.  She   s attended all dialysis sessions recently for her full time; she has had two infiltrations that resulted in early removal from the HD machine, but she made up her time on other days.  She feels she has been becoming increasingly volume overloaded for the last 1-2 weeks; she has requested an additional (4th) HD session each week but her OP center has not been able to accommodate her. 

The patient went to Internal Medicine this AM and had a brachicephalic stenosis dilated near the site of a prior stent.

CXR:      Patchy opacity at the medial right lung base which may be related
	to atelectasis or pneumonia in the proper clinical setting.
	There is a graft like material in the midline that is unchanged in the previous study 
             and may represent an SVC stent.   

ECG: ST @ 92  Axis    78  LAHB 

Impression
Facial swelling, r/o SVC syndrome
  -It is unclear if the stenosis in the brachiocephalic vein explains the facial swelling. 
  -D/w Dr. Asher, intervention nephrology: thrombosis of another vein not seen at fistulogram might explain symptoms 
  -Infection may be contributing to presentation     she had chills at HD and low grade temp in ED
Pulmonary Infiltrate
ESRD/HD
S/p two failed RTx
Anemia 
Seizure d/o 


Recommendations
IV Abx to cover abdomen, lung, possible intravascular infection
  -Vancomycin 750 mg in HD
  -Suggest Aztreonam or alternative in this PCN/Quinolone allergic patient 
CT Angiogram
Blood cultures - will send from HD 
We will check full set of chemistries in HD
She was not therapeutic on her coumadin and appears to need a higher dose 

HD Plan     3-4-2087 
We will confirm outpatient prescription with OP unit 
   -Tentative Rx:  Opti 160 4 hours  2 K 2.5 Ca bath  UF TBD based on weight 
  -Electrolytes:   K mildly elevated, typical for HD patient after weekend, HD will correct. 
  -EDW/Volume:  Moderately volume overloaded in setting of venous stenosis of access/ plus 2 day weekend. 
  -Anemia:  Continue OP EPO in the form of Aranesp. 
  -Ca/PO4/PTH:   We will recheck PTH in HD.  Please continue Phoslo     Fosrenol with meals.
