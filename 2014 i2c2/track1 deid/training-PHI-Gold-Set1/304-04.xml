History of present illness

			

  This was a followup visit for this 28-year-old black man with the medical problems of type 1 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and chronic renal insufficiency. The patient states that since I last saw him, he is being evaluated further for renal transplant. In addition, attempts were made to place an AV fistula for dialysis in his right arm and this did not work out. Given that this one did not work out, a decision was made to wait to see if there was a transplant candidate for him to get a renal transplant rather than put all of the pieces in place for hemodialysis if in fact he would need it. Most recently, the patient's creatinine was 6.4 and his BUN was 46 two weeks ago.



Major Problems





Diabetes mellitus

Type 1 diabetes mellitus.  The patient's diabetes is currently well controlled on his current regimen of NPH and Regular Insulin.  Most recently, his hemoglobin A1c was 6.6 on 02/27/2062.  The patient states that all of his fingersticks at home have been consistently between 70 and 110.



Chronic renal insufficiency

The patient is being evaluated for renal transplant and possible candidate that his family members and friends will be tested to see whether there are a match shortly.



Hypertension

The patient is on a tremendous amount of medication to treat his hypertension. Currently, he is on labetalol 600 mg PO BID, furosemide 20 mg PO QD, clonidine 0.3 mg PO QHS, lisinopril 40 mg PO QD, and nifedipine XL 90 mg PO QHS. BHypertension is currently well controlled on this regimen.



Erectile dysfunction

The patient was experiencing erectile dysfunction largely on Toprol.  For this reason, the Toprol was discontinued and the patient is having less of a problem with this issue currently.



Anemia

The patient's anemia is due to multiple different factors.  He has recently been started on erythropoietin, which he is getting via injection in the Internal Medicine three times a week.  Most recently, his hematocrit was 29.4% two weeks ago.



Thrombocytosis

The patient is on Hydria 500 mg PO QD for this problem and he is being followed by Hematology.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient's hyperlipidemia is new.  Most recently, his lipids were done on 02/27/2062 and at that time his total cholesterol was 294 and his LDL was 209.  This is a new problem for the patient, given that his lipids were fairly normal six months ago.  Given this, the patient was started on Lipitor 20 mg PO QD for hyperlipidemia.  We will repeat his lipid panel at the time of his next visit in eight weeks.
