HPI:
69 F with DM, CHF with preserved EF, GIB from a small bowel source, and diffuse body aches.


She has been feeling quite well recently, and states her shortness of breath seems better during the spring/summer.  Her mood is good, although she has persistent neck and shoulder pain for which she was seen in the pain clinic.


Regarding her DM, her usual pre-and post-prandial FS are in the 160-220 range, on lantus 90 U BID and Novolog 60 U qAC for each meal.  Reviewing her diet, she is clearly not complaint with the nutritional advice she has been given.  She continues to eat Mexican cuisine rich in carbohydrates and fried food.
