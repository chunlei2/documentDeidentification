Blood culture x2 pending
Wound: gram stain G+ Cocci clusters, culture pending.

EKG NSR, LAD, prominent T   s compared to previous, resolution of Q in III.

Impression/Plan: 
56yoF h/o complicated DM2 presents w/ osteomyelitis of R foot.  Nausea/vomiting likely multifactorial: gastroparesis, hyperglycemia (though no significant ketosis).  Patient has consented to TMA for treatment of osteomyelitis.

OSTEOMYELITIS: vanc/zosyn for now.  No h/o MRSA.  F/u wound culture, if no MRSA, consider switch to nafcillin.
	-good pulse to foot, likely w/ have reasonable healing. Art LENIS of R leg.
-TMA after stress. EKG, CXR, coags, blood bank sample. R/o MI, adenosine MIBI for pre-op (NPO p MN, study has been called in)
	-will need peri-operative beta-blockade.
DM2:
	-home regimen for now: hold R and decrease N when NPO, start d5w 1/2NS + K at 125cc/h. regular insulin sliding scale
	-check A1C
	-will need 24h urine albumin; when infection has been stabilized.
	-f/b Dr. Quintanar.
	-ASA, atenolol, lisinopril, statin.
CRI: at baseline creatinine

ANEMIA: ACD +/- Fe deficiency. At baseline.
	-check fe studies
ELEVATED GLOBULIN: likely in setting of osteomyelitis, chronic infection
	-check SPEP
ELEVATED ALK PHOS:
	-likely from bone destruction, check 5    NT, RUQ u/s.
FEN: no conc sweets, no added salt, 2000cc fluid restriction.
PROPHY: nexium, fragmin 5000u sc qd.
CODE: FULL
