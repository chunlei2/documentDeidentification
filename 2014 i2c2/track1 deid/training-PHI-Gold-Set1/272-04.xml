CC: SOB, DOE x 5 days



HPI: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w severe SOB and DOE.  Five days PTA, the Pt became SOB while walking up the stairs to his apartment on the 3rd floor.  He took a SL NG pill which he says alleviated the SOB and allowed him to continue.  Over the next few days, his SOB became progressively worse and occurred at rest.  His SOB would awaken him from his sleep, occurring 3-4x/ night.  He states that SL NG pills alleviated his PND.  The Pt sleeps on one pillow.  During the course of his worsening SOB, his exercise tolerance decreased from a baseline of walking 2.5 hours without any SOB to walking for 1.5 hours with multiple stops due to SOB.  These episodes of SOB were not associated w/ CP (pleuritic or otherwise), palpitations, F/C, N/V, diaphoresis, abdominal discomfort, or pain in his arms or jaw.  



Also during this time, the Pt noted progressive b/l swelling of his legs (from ankles to knees) and increasing abdominal girth.  He states that his legs would pit when he pressed on them.  The LE swelling were not associated w/ calf pain.  On the day before admission, however, he did develop a non-productive, dry cough.  On the DOA, his Sx had worsened to the point where he felt like he needed to be seen by a doctor.  He was subsequently driven to NYSH-East by his wife and son, where he was seen and then re-directed to NYSH.     



At NYSH-East, the Pt's vitals were: T 97.6 P 52-55 BP 167/77 O2Sat 98% Wt 188.5# w/ clothes.

The Pt received Lasix 40mg IV and O2 @ 3L/min.



At NYSH-Ed, the Pt's vitals were: P 48 BP 157/78 RR 20 O2Sat 99% on 2L

The Pt received ASA 325mg PO. 

Since receiving the Lasix, the Pt's LE edema has drastically diminished, and the Pt states that he feels a lot better.



The Pt has not experienced any recent weight loss and is on a regular diet without salt restriction (he uses salt 2-3x/wk).  He also claims that he is adherent to taking his meds.

EKG:   NSR, bradycardia (54bpm), LAE, TW-flattening in V5,V6. Biphasic TW in V2-V4. LVH by voltage criteria.  No difference from past EKGs.



CXR FINDINGS:

	Cardiac AICD projecting over the left hemithorax, unchanged. Lung fields are clear. 

Cardiomediastinal contours are unchanged. Right sided diaphragmatic hernia, unchanged. Bony 

thorax is unchanged.



No evidence of active cardiopulmonary disease. 



Echo (6/93):  EF 60%, symmetric LVH



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: This is a 73yo male w/ a complicated PMH that includes HTN, DM, hyperlipidemia, CAD, and a past MI, which resulted in the placement of an AICD, who now p/w SOB.

	

PE - This is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out.  Although, there were no 

CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs.  Consider D-dimer to rule out recent PE.   

	Ischemia  - EKG and the negative set of cardiac enzymes x2 does not suggest this. However, Pt 

has not had any acute Sx while on the floor. 

PNA - This is less likely given the lack of fever or elevated WBC.

Tumor - This is also less likely given the lack of weight loss, the acute nature of the symptoms, 

and the lacko f lymphadenopathy.



1)	SOB - Most likely CHF>PE/DVT>ischemia>>PNA,tumor; however, he currently appears asymptomatic. PE is still possible given the lack of diagnostic studies to rule out, although there were no CP or calf pain suggestive of DVTs, and the onset was not acute.  The Pt may have had an exertional ischemia but the lack of CP and EKGs changes makes this less likely; however, the Pt has been asymptomatic on the floor and so no EKG tracings concomitant with the SOB are available to completely rule out this possibility.  PNA and tumor are less likely given the lack of fevers and chills and any hx of weight loss.  



Will start the Pt on O2 in addition to his normal medicinal regimen of diuretics, beta-blockers, and ACE-I.  Will consider the addition of spironolactone.  Order echo to determine EF and to identify structural myocardial changes if any.  Order LFT's to check for decreased perfusion to vital organs.  Monitor UOP for kidney functions.  Monitor EKG for any changes.  Will send for a D-dimer to r/o recent PE. 



2)	HTN - Poorly controlled, may be 2o to missing meds today. Will also be treated using meds for CHF.

3)	DM - Sugars elevated.  Will treat w/ his home medication of glucophage and glyburide.

4)	Hyperlipidemia - Stable. Cont home medication of Lipitor.

5)	FEN - Switch to low salt diet with no concentrated sweet.  Consider a diabetic diet as well.

6)	Dispo - Will d/c once Pt is stabilized.

12/10/94 Intern addendum:



Patient seen and examined with med student above.  Agree with overall assessment above.  Briefly:



This is a 73M with a hx of CAD s/p MI, s/p AICD, IDDM, HTN, and hyperlipidemia, who presents with DOE, PND and bilateral leg edema x4 days.  DOE is not associated with anginal symptoms including CP, nausea, vomiting, and diaphoresis, although the patient reports it is relieved by nitroglycerine.  Physical exam findings here are notable for a flat JVP, absence of crackles, 2/6 SEM at LLSB and apex, and mild, symmetric, pitting edema in bilateral lower extremities.  Per chart notes, in clinic he was noted to have bulging neck veins.  



Favor CHF >?pacer malfunction, ischemia > PE.  CHF is a somewhat confusing picture as symptoms suggest L-sided failure with pulmonary edema while there is little objective data (no crackles on exam, CXR clear) to suggest this.  Prior to our evaluation he received 40 of IV Lasix and diuresed at least one liter (with subjective improvement), which may account for this discrepancy.  



Plan is for echo to evaluate his LV function, pacer interrogation, and stress.  D-dimer should be sufficient to pursue PE as this is a low-prob possibility.
