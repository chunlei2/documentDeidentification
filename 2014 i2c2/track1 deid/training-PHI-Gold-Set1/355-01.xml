Main issue is whether his hematologic abnormalities are secondary to infection, presumably immiune-mediated, or whether there is primary hematologic disorder with worrisome WBC/diff. Has clinical bleeding as well as thrombocytopenia.  Lung abnormality may be pneumonia, but given context needs further definition--unlikely bacterial. 



I've asked Dr. Flora Cole to consult.
