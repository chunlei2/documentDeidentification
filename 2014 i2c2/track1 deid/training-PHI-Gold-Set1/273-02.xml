Interim History:	

Comes to review his medical problems.



Hip X-Rays may have shown early degenerative changes. Still has pain from them on a daily basis but it is minor. Has not tried any analgesics, even acetaminophen. 

Shoulders have bothered her for years and she has seen Dr. Baird with diagnosis of adhesive capsulitis. Hands have bothered her in the past but do not currently. 



A1c has been over 9 % and she says that control has not changed. Does not have records but says that she tests about tid.

Retinopathy:	Saw Dr. Aragon a few weeks ago. Now going only yearly. Last laser was about 2.5 years ago. Reports that vision was 20/20 in one eye and 20/25 in the other.

Nephropathy:	Cr was 1.4 in July. Says that transplant clinic wanted her to return a month after the last visit but she did not want to do so. She thinks that it was for follow-up of an elevated WBC. However, her WBC has been normal over the last several visits. 

Neuropathy:	Not consistent with taking the Neurontin, and notes it she misses it.

Cardiac:	No chest pain or unusual dyspnea on exertion. Does feel out of shape if she climbs    100 stairs   .  She is seeing Dr. Dotson in two weeks.  

Vascular:	No claudication

Impressions and Plan:	

Hard to refine her diabetes control without more data.

No specific indication of recurrent problems with coronary artery disease, but she seems worried about the dyspnea on exertion which she experiences and so will try to clear the air with ETT. ETT with sestamibi.

Try to get flu shot locally.  If unsuccessful, call here every few weeks to see whether we have them.
