History compiled from patient's record and son

CC:  altered mental status



HPI:  83yo female with a h/o dementia, HTN, DM, Afib, PMR, and chronic diarrhea sent from her assisted living facility for altered mental status and suspected UTI.  Per the patient's son, the staff at her facility has noted the patient to be more confused over the last 3 days.  She has had more frequent episodes of fecal incontinence with soiling of her bed and carpet. Some blood was also noted in her toilet. Her son also reports that she has been less awake than usual and has had some congestion and coughing.  She has had no fevers, chills, chest pain, sob, nausea, vomiting, or urinary symptoms. A urinalysis was reportedly positive at her assisted living facility and the patient was sent to the emergency department for further evaluation. 



At baseline, the patient is generally quite confused.  She knows her name and often location but not the date/year and talks frequently of her late husband and parents whom she believes are still alive. Her assisted living facility has recently suggested that she be transferred to their higher level of care program.



ED: T 98.1, P 110, R 20, BP 130/56, SaO2 98% RA. She has dry MM. Lungs clear. Heart irregular. AAOx1 and otherwise nonfocal neuro exam. Her initial labs were notable for a Hct of 44.6 which was 34.5 on repeat. Rectal exam brown stool guaiac positive. CXR showed no sign of pneumonia. Urinalysis was negative for any signs of infection. Blood cultures were sent. The patient was treated with levofloxacin 500mg po and 3LNS, as well as many of her home meds, including Lopressor, Sotalol, prednisone, iron, thiamine, folic acid, mvi, calcium, glyburide, and effexor. Aspirin was held. She was transfused one unit of PRBCs and admitted to medicine for further evaluation.

Dig level 0.3



Blood cx 1/29/95 x2 NGTD

urine cx 1/29/95 NG



CXR 1/29/95: minimal left basilar subsegmental atelectasis



EKG: aflutter with variable block, no ischemic changes



A/P:  83 yo female with dementia, HTN, DM, AF, and PMR with worsening mental status over several days. Per report, her urinalysis was positive at her living facility, however there is no evidence of urinary or other infection now (now WBC or fever; CXR neg, Ucx/Blcx NG). Suspect her altered mental status is secondary to progressive dementia and dehydration. The patient was also noted to have blood in her stool at home and a 10 point Hct drop in the emergency department. While the patient did get 3L of fluid in between which could cause dilutional anemia, given the patient's history of blood in stool and guaiac positivity, will work-up possible GI bleed. 



1.	Decreased Hct- GIB v. dilutional.  Does have h/o diverticulitis.

a.	Serial Hcts q8

b.	2 large bore IVs at all times

c.	Consider GI consult if Hct continues to drop for possible EGD/colonoscopy (although pt has had multiple unsuccessful colonoscopy attempts in past)

d.	Nexium 40mg po qd

2.	AMS- likely progressive dementia in setting of dehydration. 

a.	F/u urine and blood cultures

b.	Hold antibiotics as no clear source of infection

c.	Check TSH, B12, folate, LFTs, lytes

d.	Hydrated in ED

e.	Check head CT

f.	Attempt to wean effexor; consult geri-psych per attending

3.	Rhythm- has h/o afib and SVT, now in aflutter with variable block. HR goes up with activity and when due for meds.

a.	Cont lopressor, sotalol, digoxin

b.	Hold aspirin for possible GIB

c.	Telemetry monitoring

4.	Hyperlipidemia- statin recently increased

a.	Check fasting lipids

b.	LFTs

5.	Diabetes- glyburide recently increased. Will hold for now in case needs to be NPO.

a.	RISS coverage

b.	Check HbA1c

6.	PMR- Cont Prednisone 5mg po qd; would like to try to taper if possible

7.	FEN- appears euvolemic now. Diabetic diet.

8.	Prophy- no fragmin/heparin. Pneumoboots. Nexium.

9.	Dispo- consult physical therapy

10.	Code- FULL CODE, discussion with son
