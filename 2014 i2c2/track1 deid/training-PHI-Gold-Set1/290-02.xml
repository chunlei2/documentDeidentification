His family history is positive for diabetes (mother diagnosed in her 80s).  He has required a regular insulin gtt protocol intermittently postop. He is now on a full liquid diet.

Insulin gtt off at present

 

Mr. Ehlers is a 69 yo M h/o CAD s/p MI 2084 (posterolateral), HTN, hyperlipidemia, a-fib, AAA, PVD, smoking (50 pk yr) who presents for CABG. Initially presented to Bonner General Hospital 9/97 for w/u of exertional chest pain. Cardiac cath was unsuccessful via femoral approach due to presumed aortoiliac occlusion. Subsequent cath 10/18/97 revealed left main stenosis with distal occlusion, RCA proximal occlusion and diffuse LAD stenosis. Pt was transferred to BHCC on 10/19 for further evaluation by the cardiology service. On 10/21 he underwent echo which revealed EF 55% with mild AS. On 10/22, cardiac cath revealed 3 V disease. Cardiac surgery was consulted and recommended CABG after medical optimization. His anginal symptoms remained stable and he was subsequently discharged home on 10/23. He now returns for surgical revascularization. Since his discharge on 10/23, he has not experienced any new or worsening chest pain or SOB. Denies orthopnea, PND.
