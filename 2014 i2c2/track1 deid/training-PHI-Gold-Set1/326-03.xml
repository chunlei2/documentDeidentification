HOSPITAL COURSE: The patient underwent revision of her left upper arm A-V fistulae by Dr. Schmitt

Utilizing a temporary femoral dialysis catheter. She was noted to be persistently anemic with a 

Hematocrit of 23.3% on 9/05/86. It was felt that her low hematocrit was due to both blood loss from

Persistent severe menorrhagia as well as a dilutional component from fluid overload. She was electively 

transfused 2 units of packed cells on 9/05/86 while on dialysis utilizing her revised A-V fistulae. 

The rest of her hospital course was uneventful. She was hyperphosphatemic in hospital and was given dietary counseling for use of her phosphate binders. She was discharged home with recommendations for a GYN

Follow-up to assess her persistent mennorhagia and for f/u with her vascular surgeon Dr. Schmitt. She will continue 3x/week dialysis in her Educare-Pullman outpatient unit.
