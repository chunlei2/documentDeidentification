EDVISIT^42272668^SPARKS, CHARLES^8/13/2079^SORENSEN, SAUL

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Leach.  Resident's note

was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and I

confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, this is a 74-year-old

gentleman who presents with 2 days of chills, fevers, fatigue,

and increased urinary frequency.  He has no other complaints or

associated symptoms.

Please review resident's note for full details of past medical

history, social history, review of systems, medications, and

allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake, alert, in mild to moderate

respiratory distress, breathing with a respiratory rate at 34,

oximetry noted at 88% on room air, temperature is 102 Fahrenheit,

pulse is 104, blood pressure is 213/89, and oximetry came up

nicely to 93% on 4 liters and 100% on nonrebreather facemask. 

Neck is supple.  Mucous membranes are dry.  Lungs reveal slightly

decreased breath sounds at the bases; however, there are few

crackles noted in the left lower base.  Heart is tachycardic but

regular.  The remainder of the exam is unremarkable.

LABORATORY DATA:  White count is noted at 11.6 and hematocrit

28.2.  This is close to the patient's baseline.  BUN and

creatinine 69 and 5.8, 5.8 is quite elevated for this patient. 

However, he has been evaluated for recent diagnosis of renal

failure by the Nephrology Service.  Bicarbonate is 21 and

potassium is 4.3.  Urinalysis reveals some blood and protein,

otherwise not suggestive of an infection.  EKG is tachycardic

with left ventricular hypertrophy in a strain pattern.  Chest

x-ray shows diffuse fluffy infiltrates bilaterally with bilateral

pleural effusions, few Kerley B lines, and fluid in the lungs

fissures.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was covered with

ceftriaxone and azithromycin for his presumed pneumonia.  He also

received nitro paste for preload reduction as well as a Foley

catheter and Lasix, all for his CHF.

DISPOSITION:  The patient was admitted to the hospital.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

DIAGNOSES:  Pneumonia, CHF, and renal failure.
