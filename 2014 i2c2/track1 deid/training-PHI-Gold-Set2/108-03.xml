History of Presenting Illness
Mr. Egan is a 72 year old male with a history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia and Type II DM. Two weeks ago, he noted intermittent episodes of exertional dyspnea. He was started on albuterol and advair with no improvement. On 08/30/2135, he experienced worsening exertional shortness of breath and mild chest discomfort. He sought medical attention at Natchaug Hospital ED. An initial ECG revealed Q waves in V1-V4. He ruled in for an myocardial infarction with a troponin on 2.0. He was found to be in congestive heart failure. He was given plavix, aspirin, lovenox and IV lasix with improvement in symptoms. 
On 08/31/2135, he was transferred to Gibson Community Hospital for cardiac catheterization. The results were significant for multivessel coronary artery disease and moderate mitral valve regurgitation with an left ventricular ejection fraction of 25 to 30%. He was referred to Dr. Sebastian Dang for elective cardiac surgical revascularization and possible mitral valve repair. He was discharged to home on 09/02/2135. 
On 09/03/2135, he developed recurrent left sided chest pressure while at rest. He took 2 SL TNG with improvement in symptoms. He presented to Gibson Community Hospital ED. He was started on IV heparin. Initial cardiac biomarkers were negative. He was found to have an elevated BNP to 2817. A CXR showed congestive heart failure. He was admitted to CAU. He had an episode of chest pressure while at rest that resolved with 1 SL TNG. He is being referred for consideration of cardiac surgery.
