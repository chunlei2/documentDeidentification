EKG:

Old left bundle branch block, normal sinus 66. 



CXR:

FINDINGS:

	No infiltrates or evidence of CHF is present.  There is a three cm

	mass in the right lower lung.  This was shown to be rounded

	atelectasis on chest CT.  Pleural changes are consistent with

	asbestos related pleural disease.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Asbestos related pleural disease

	Right lower lobe mass shown to be rounded atelectasis on chest CT.

	

CT:



CT Chest	

	FINDINGS:

	No comparison.  The aorta is of normal caliber.  There is

	atherosclerotic calcification of the aorta.  Classic arch anatomy

	is present.

	Bilateral pleural calcific plaques are demonstrated consistent

	with asbestos related pleural disease.  In addition, in the

	posterior segment right lower lobe there is 2.7 cm mass.  The mass

	has a linear pleural attachment adjacent to pleural plaques.

	There is also present swirling vessels around the mass and volume

	loss.  The findings are consistent with rounded atelectasis.  A

	smaller focus of rounded atelectasis is present in the left lower

	lobe.

	Coronary artery calcifications present.  No mediastinal or hilar

	or axillary lymphadenopathy is present.  There is no

	supraclavicular adenopathy.

	The osseous structures are unremarkable.

	Please see dictated abdomen report.

	



IMPRESSION:

	1.  Normal caliber aorta please see MRA report regarding

	evaluation of dissection.

	2.  Bilateral rounded atelectasis and asbestos related pleural

	disease.

	

	



   WMC  MRA AORTA + &  01-Aug-2076 09:10 





REPORT:

	This study was reviewed with Dr. Upshur.

	MRA OF THE THORAX WAS WITH AND WITHOUT GADOLINIUM.

	Technique: Standard departmental MRA protocol of the chest and

	upper abdomen was performed with and without gadolinium. 3-D

	images were obtained and interpreted.

	Findings:

	There is a three vessel aortic arch.  There is no evidence of a

	flap within the aorta to suggest a dissection. The takeoffs of the

	great vessels are normally patent. There is no evidence of

	aneurysm.

	The celiac artery and SMA are patent. There are single renal

	arteries bilaterally.  There is mild narrowing of the proximal

	right renal artery.  The left renal artery is patent.

	



IMPRESSION:

	Unremarkable MRA of the thoracic aorta, without evidence of

	dissection or aneurysm.

	Mild narrowing of the proximal right renal artery.

	

	____________________________________________



A/P:	This is a 70 year old man with acute shortness of breath and back pain. 



1.	 Cardiology - Will rule out for MI

Received ASA, SLNG, Lasix, beta-blocker in ED

Cardiac monitor, cycle enzymes

On atenolol, irbesartan as outpatient;  will continue hydralazine for better management.	

  	2.	Renal - cr 1.8, appears close to baseline, consistent with chronic renal insufficiency, likely due to hypertensive disease

Will continue to follow

  	3.	Endo - diabetic, non-insulin dependent

SS insulin, will convert to NPH once daily requirement is clear

  	4.	Musculoskeletal - history and present complaint of chronic back pain, low to mid-back

Percocet for pain relief as NSAID contraindicated in CRI

  	5.	Psych - volatile personality, significant anger toward doctors after wife's death 8 years ago

Will attempt to minimize aggravating situations

  	6.	FEN

Repleted phosporus

  	7.	Prophylaxis

Ambulating, on nexium.

  	8.	Dispo

Home after acute cardiac workup complete; will have further risk stratification done through Shenandoah Hospital.
