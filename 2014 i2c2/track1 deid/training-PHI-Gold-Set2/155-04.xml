IMPRESSION is of L opercular syndrome- embolic postprocedure.

However, MR-DWI suggests shower of several tiny foci, ditally in cortex anteriorly both on R and L, and old R talamocapsular lacune (possibly related to her 2076 event).



No a lysis candidate. Could resume heparin for her CAD, if indicated.
