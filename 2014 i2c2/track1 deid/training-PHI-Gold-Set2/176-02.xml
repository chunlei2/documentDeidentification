Mr. Ostrander is here for follow-up of his thyroid situation, however due to 
scheduling difficulties he is only having his thyroid uptake and scan 
currently.  He took the tracer and he had his first scan now and the 
testing wont be done until tomorrow.  Thyroid function tests were 
completely normal.  His chest x-ray is completely normal except for 
tracheal deviation I believe which is due to his goida.  I talked to him 
that if the nodule were cold we will need a fine needle aspirate.  I also 
said to him that he made need to see a thyroid specialist.  Though 
slightly anxious he is agreeable to this.
 
He did not bring with him the pathology final report of his lymph node 
biopsy but he was told it was a reaction to an infection and no further 
follow-up or treatment was necessary.
We then talked about smoking cessation and he and his live-in have picked 
a date namely Jun 8th to quit .I tried to give him as much encouragement 
for that as I could.
