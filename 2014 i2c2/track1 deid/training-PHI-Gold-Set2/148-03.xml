CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Etheridge, Shari 

MR: 2931335

Admitting Cardiologist: Travis

PCP: 



Date of Admission to WGH: January 19th, 2087



ID/CC: 84 year-old woman with CAD, CHF, COPD presents with shortness of breath. 



HPI: (Obtained from patient).  Ms. Etheridge has a history of coronary artery disease, stating that she has a    heart problem.     She is unable to give more details at the present time.  Per old records, she carries the diagnosis of CAD and diastolic heart failure EF 55%.  

	She was in her usual state of health until 3 days prior to admission, when she began to complain of    a cold.     She felt chills, even though it was warm in her house.  That day she suffered a mechanical fall, slipping on a blanket in her home.  She hit her left eye, but denies LOC.  The next day, she was    achy    all over, noted a dry cough, and was    wheezy.     The day prior to admission, she states that she    couldn't breath    and had to come into the ER.

On arrival to WGH at 11:30AM 01/18/88 vitals were: P 93  BP 121/82  RR 22  96% on room air.  She had a prolonged ER course of 31 hours duration.  Initially, she was treated for presumed COPD flare with nebulizers, prednisone and doxycycline.  A rapid flu test was positive for influenza A.  She received 1 liter of normal saline.  Approximately 6 hours later, she complained of 7/10 mid sternal chest pain, non-radiating.  EKG showed: sinus tachycardia @115bpm, with STE 1mm AVR, and STD II, V3-V5.  Her pain came to 1/10 with 2L NTG and Ativan.  Small doses of IV lopressor were given.  STDs partially resolved.  Around 10AM the day of admission  (01/19/88) her blood pressure acutely rose to 190 systolics, her heart rate increased to 106bpm.  Per the patient, she remembers having a coughing fit, and being unable to catch her breath.  She was placed on CPAP, then switched to BiPAP for ABG: 125/78/7.13.  She was felt clinically to be in flash pulmonary edema.  She was treated with nebulizers, intravenous TNG, lasix and BiPAP.  With improvement in hemodynamics, her pain and shortness of breath improved.  Enzymes were drawn and showed: trop 0.22, CK 122, MB 11.7.  She was started on heparin, integrillin (though unclear if she received it).

The patient currently denies pain.  She is extremely anxious, refusing blood draws, etc.

3.	(01/18/88 @ 18:47) Sinus tach at 115bpm.  STD more pronounced.

4.	(01/19/88 @ 21:33) NSR at 87 bpm.  STD essentially resolved.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 84 year-old woman with CAD, COP, CABG who presents with shortness of breath.  Found to be influenza A positive.  Initially with negative cardiac enzymes, then became positive in the setting of pulmonary edema.  Likely demand event.



1.	Ischemia: EKG now stable

a.	ASA, Plavix, heparin

i.	No role for IIB/IIIA

b.	Beta-blocker and ACE-I as tolerated.

c.	Maximize respiratory status

d.	Daily EKGs, trend enzymes 

2.	Pump: Episode of flash pulmonary edema

a.	Received 20mg IV Lasix, unclear urine output

b.	Run negative 500-1000cc/day

3.	Rhythm: Now NSR, reported Afib with RVR in ED.

a.	No EKGs with AF

b.	Tolerated Beta-blocker in ED, can give if necessary for rate control

4.	Shortness of Breath: Likely flu in addition to CHF, COPD.

5.	Altered Mental Status:

a.	Patient became agitated overnight

b.	Per daughter does not have a history of sundowning on prior recent hospitalizations

c.	Rule out CO2 narcosis (based on ED gas), head bleed (recent trauma possible SDH in setting of heparin use), medications, etc

i.	Head CT

ii.	ABG

6.	Prophylaxis:

a.	Hold anticoagulation until bleed ruled out

b.	PPI
