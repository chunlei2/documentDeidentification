CARDIOLOGY

MAHASKA COUNTY HOSPITAL



Reason for visit:

   Angiography for claudication and chronic renal insufficiency



Interval History:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who has experienced claudication for approximately five to six years.  He describes his claudication as bilateral shin pain which radiates up to his knees.  His symptoms have worsened over the past two to three years and are now limiting his lifestyle.  He is able to walk approximately two to three city blocks when the pain starts and is relieved with rest.  He denies rest symptoms.  He was recently evaluated by Dr. Curtis Cochran for his claudication syjmptoms.  After an extensive conversation and a review of hsi options, Mr. Vines decided to pursue catheter based revascularization.



He underwent adominal aortography and iliofemoral angiography today which demonstrated:

-grossly patent celiac axis, SMA and IMA

-single renal arteries bilaterally with ostial/proximal 65-70% stenosis on the left; the right renal artery has proximal 30% stenosis

-diffuse atherosclerosis of the infrarenal abdominal aorta with 10-20% stenosis

-right common iliac artery diffuse 20-30% stenosis

-right internal iliac artery ostial 70% stenosis

-right external iliac artery patent

-right common femoral artery patent

-right profunda femoris patent

-right SFA with bulky, calcific eccentric 95% stenosis



-left internal iliac ostial 40% stenosis

-left external iliac aratery patent

-left common femoral artery calcific eccentric 70% stenosis

-left profunda femoris patent

-diffuse left SFA 60-70% stenosis in the mid vessel with supraimposed focal 80-90% stenosis

-total occlusion of the left popliteal artery with reconstitution at the TP trunk

-total occlusion of the left anterior tibial artery

-collaterals reconstitute the left peroneal and posterior tibial artery



Mr. Vines underwent dilation of the left femoral artery, dilation of the popliteal occlusion and overlapping Absolute stents to his left SFA.  He arrives to Internal Medicine mildly hypertensive with SBP 140-170s.

Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Vines is a 70 year old male who presents today for angiograpy for lifestyle limiting claudication.  He underwent dilation of his left common femoral artery, dilation of his popliteal occlusion and placement of two overlapping Absolute stents to his left SFA.  There will be further discussion to undergo a staged intervention of his left reanl artery and right SFA calcific lesions as an outpatient.



1.  PVD-Plan to continue current medical regimen.  Plan for Plavix for one month.  Further discussions of his left renal artery and right SFA lesions to be discussed as an outpatient.  Patient would benefit from CNIS due t his bilateral carotid stenoses but may obtain as an outpatient.



2.  CARDIAC

ISCHEMIA-No symptoms.  Continue his current regimen.  His recent lipid panel is at target.  

PUMP-Euvolemic on exam.  Hypertensive on arrival to unit and received additional nitrates.  Will monitor response and consider added Norvasc.  

RATE/RHYTHM-Well controlled on Toprol.



3.  RENAL-Patient received sodium bicarbonate drip for renal protection.  Plan to add mucomyst.  Monitor renal function and urine output.  Continue lisinopril as he as been taking this as an outpatient and tolerating it.



4.  PUD-Continue PPI.



5.  DISPO-Anticipate discharge home in the am and follow-up with Dr. Cochran and his cardiologist Edward Benitez.





Further plans per Dr. Cochran.
