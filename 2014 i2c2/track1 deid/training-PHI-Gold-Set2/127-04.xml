MR# 6894069

Admit Date: 3/31/77

PCP: Rivers, Xavier (Westlake-Shenandoah Hospital)



CC: chest pain

 

HPI: 71M hx DM, HLP, HTN, p/w chest pain. Pt reports having markedly reduced right eye visual acuity this evening, subsequently became increasingly anxious and    nervous    and developed chest tightness across chest at level of xiphoid. Intermittently had sharp pains in same distribution, reaching 5/10 in severity. Associated nausea and dry heaving, only briefly SOB. No associated lightheadedness, diaphoresis, or palpitations. Called daughter who then called Shenandoah Hospital emergency line, then called MVH and came into their emergency room where he was referred to WMC ER secondary to chest discomfort. Symptoms had resolved by time of being seen in WMC ER. 



Of note, pt admitted to LMC (9/76) for acute onset SOB/CP. At that time, had negative PE protocol CT and adeno-MIBI. Just prior to that was admitted to WMC for similar symptoms and had negative dissection protocol CT at that time.

Imaging:

CXR (3/31/77): No acute process



EKG: NSR. LBBB. 1mm STD I/II/aVf/V5-6. 2mm STE V1-3. TWI I, biphasic T-wave V5-6. (No change from prior ekg)



Impression: 71M hx DM, HTN, HLP, p/w chest pain likely GI related and not cardiac in origin.



Plan: 

1.	chest pain: Unlikely cardiac in origin given negative EKG, recent normal stress test, and atypical nature. Likely GI related as pt with dry heaving around time of chest tightness.

-cont asa, simvastatin, atenolol, irbesartan, and lasix

-repeat EKG in AM

-cycle cardiac enzymes, telemetry

-check lipid panel

-maalox prn



2.	decreased visual acuity: Most likely worsening macular degeneration given recent chronic history of symptoms. Absence of pain makes retinal vascular occlusion very unlikely, no other neurological symptoms to indicate CVA. 

-refer pt back to MVH once ruled out for MI

-consider I- CT if more neuro symptoms develop to r/o acute stroke



3.	Diabetes: -check lipid panel, hemoglobin A1c

-RISS, glipizide

-hold pioglitazone (not in formulary)



4.	proph: nexium, heparin
