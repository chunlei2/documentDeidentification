Interim History:	

Comes to review diabetes and related problems.

He had L THR in April

Has gained some weight since the surgery.

Home Blood Tests:  

B 	87-140's, and occasionally in the 200's, which he attributes to    bad food    the previous evening. 

Retinopathy:	He has seen Dr. Dailey within a month or so. Again going next week. He has had a Bell's palsy by report. It has improved very significant ly. 

Nephropathy:	Due for microalbumin/creatinine ratio; normal in past.

Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.

Cardiac:	No chest pain. No unusual dyspnea on exertion though he does have stable dyspnea on exertion doing activities in the house. 

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Medications: He is on more insulin than he was prior to his hip surgery.



Social History: 

He is planning to return to work as a printing press operator. He thinks that he can handle it and gets to sit down a lot.

His wife has been having problems with what he thinks to be complications of radiation therapy for gynecologic cancer.

Bring the heel ulcer to Dr. Chandler's attention when he sees him next week.
