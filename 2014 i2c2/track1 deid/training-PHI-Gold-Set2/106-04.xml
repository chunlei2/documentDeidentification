CCU Admission Note
Patient Name: Justus, Quiana
MR# 9814048
Location: Internal Medicine
PCP: Xayachack, Ida, M.D.
Date of Admission: 3/18/91
CC: STEMI


HPI: 
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with new onset chest pain and shortness of breath and was found to have lateral STEMI. It began last Sunday, when she noticed the new onset of back pain, which progressed and was associated with shortness of breath by Monday. She apparently called EMS on Tuesday then and en route she had a long run of VT, which responded to 50mg of Lidocaine IV. She was intubated on arrival in the ED for progressive respiratory distress. ECG showed lateral ST elevations and a CT scan of her chest was negative for any signs of aortic dissection. Of note, she was also noticed to have elevated blood sugars in the 500s in the ED with an AG of 20, that came down to 16. 


On immediate LHC, a 100% occlusion of her OM1 was found and recannalized as well as stented with a Vision BMS, resulting in TIMI 2 flow. Her LAD was found to be patent but and her RCA showed diffuse atherosclerosis up to 60% stenosis at most. LV ventriculogram showed inferior hypokinesis with moderate MR.  An IABP was placed with her initial augmented diastolic pressures recorded in the 80s, which led to the initiation of Levophed, Dobutamine and Dopamine.


A PAC was placed in the cath lab as well with her initial Wedge reported as 19-20,  PAPs in the 50s.


On transfer to the CCU, she was intubated, sedated, being on IV Levophed at 20/hr, Dobutamine at 200/hr and Dopamine at 300/hr. Her CO was recorded as 6.0, her CI 3.5 with an initial SVR of 1012. Her Temp. was 96.1, HR 115 bpm, augmented diastolic BP of 124, which subsequently ranged between 70 and 100 on the day of her admission. She spiked a temperature up to 101 on the evening of admission after she received a dose of Levaquin IV in the setting of a rising WBC up to 40K. Vasopressin was added IV, which provided further support of her MAP. Intermittent NS fluid boluses helped to bring her HR down per RN and supported her MAPs with her PAD ranging between 18-24 and a urine output between 30 and 100 cc/hr. When her CI dropped to 1.9 around 9.30 pm with an increased SVR of 1550, the cardiac fellow was called and the decision was made to wean her Levophed as tolerated, which was then brought down to 16/hr with her Dopamine having been weaned off and continued Dobutamine and Vasopressin. The patient was also maintained on Reopro and Heparin IV for her STEMI.

Initial ABG was 7.12/39/61, which gradually improved up to 7.37/32/110 in the evening of her admission.


CXR:
Bilateral somewhat symmetric perihilar airspace opacities both lungs.  This could be edema or pneumonia. No large pleural effusions or pneumothoraces. Interval placement of the due left lower lobe monitor line below. Endotracheal tube and 4.6 cm.  NG tube to stomach.


CT Chest/Abdomen/Pelvis &#8211; AD protocol:
No evidence of aortic dissection, narrowed SMA at its origin. Bilateral consolidation in the dependent portions of the upper and lower lobes, consistent with aspiration and/or pneumonia. Interlobular septal thickening and small bilateral pleural effusions, consistent with pulmonary edema. Indeterminate hypodense lesion in the body of the pancreas. Differential considerations include a cyst and IPMN. Bilateral renal hypodensities, the largest of which are consistent with simple cysts. Heterogeneous thyroid gland, with areas of hypodensity.
 
Bedside TTE: no evidence of papillary muscle rupture, moderate MR present


EKG in ED at 6.32AM: NSR, STE in I, II, aVF, V5, V6
EKG in ED at 7.31AM: RAD, VT, STE in I, aVL, V5,V6
EKG on CCU Admission: NSR at 113 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, 2-3 mm in II,III, AvF
Repeat EKG 9 hours after CCU Admission: NSR at 99 , RBBB, left posterior fascicular block, 3-4 mm STE in V4-V6, II,III, AvF resolving.


Impression:
79 yo lady with DM, HTN, HL who presented with lateral STEMI with occluded OM1, s/p BM stent and is now in cardiogenic and septic shock.


Plan: 
1.        CV Pump: cardiogenic shock: continue vasopressor and inotrope support with Dobutamine, Levophed, Vasopressin, goal to wean Levophed to reduce afterload and increase CI, continue to give fluid boluses intermittently as she appeared preload dependent possibly due to RV involvement, MAP goal above 65, goal to keep CI above 2.2, f/u urine output with goal to keep above 25, trending lactic acid
2.        CV Ischemia: STEMI, cont. ASA, Plavix, Heparin, Reopro, holding BB and ACE in setting of hypotension, will check HbA1c
3.        CV Rhythm: currently NSR, on Tele
4.        Septic shock: aspiration event vs. possibly CAP, no evidence of other infectious source, covering empirically with Vancomycin/Levaquin IV given absence of recent hospitalization over the past 90 days, checking C.diff, will have low threshold to broaden coverage further if necessary
5.        HTN: currently hypotensive, holding BP meds
6.        DM: holding Metformin, RISS
7.        FEN: NPO for now with NGT on continous suctioning
8.        Prophylaxis: Heparin IV, PPI IV bid
9.        Code Status: Full Code 
10.   Dispo: pending resolution of acute medical issues
