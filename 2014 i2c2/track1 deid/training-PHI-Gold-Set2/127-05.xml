Patient seen and examined. Agree with above student note. In brief, 75yM with PMH significant for DM, HTN, high cholesterol, and macular degeneration who presents with recent onset of intermittent, transient &#8216;blotches&#8217; in left eye. Carotid US evaluation showed left sided velocities consistent with 80-85% stenosis of left proximal ICA. He is admitted pre op for operating room tomorrow. Home meds with exception of oral antihyperglycemics will be resumed. See detailed plan above.



Discussed w/ Arthur Tisdale, chief resident, who agrees w/ assessment and plan.
