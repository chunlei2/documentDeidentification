54 yo f/u



VS: 120/76  wt 390



1. OBESITY - he feels his weight is down a little.  He has been trying to eat

mainly meat and vegetables, but he is "stupid" sometimes and cheats.



2. HYPERTENSION - in good range.  He has been making an effort to avoid Na.



3. PROTEINURIA  - he has been off Naprosyn for about 6 weeks, has appt scheduled with Dr. Fry 6/05.  Will plan to repeat 24 hr urine for protein towards the end of next week.  His pedal edema has improved considerably, so possibly his albumin is better.



4. DJD - Ultam is helpful, but not as good as Naprosyn.  Knees and ankles are stiff and painful, especially if he is active and then sits still for a while.

Also has some pain in left groin/thigh c/w tendonitis.
