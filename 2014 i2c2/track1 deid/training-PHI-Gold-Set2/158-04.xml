CHIEF COMPLAINT

Chest pain



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Dr. Fredrick Debra is a 59 yo with CAD, HTN, and DM2 who presents with three days of chest discomfort and hypertension.  His symptoms started on Tuesday afternoon, three days ago, while working in the yard.  He describes substernal chest pressure that waxes and wanes in intensity, but has been constant since its onset.  It does not radiate.  It was associated with &#8220;gurgling&#8221; like &#8220;loose phlegm&#8221; in his chest at its onset, but this has since resolved.  It was worse while sitting in the car or leaning forward or backward, but not with twisting.  He has not had any recent URI symptoms.  Tylenol helps take the edge off of his discomfort.  He has been measuring his BP at home, and over the past few days it has ranged to 190/102 averaging 170/80.  He reports compliance with his medications without recent changes.  He has had worsened dyspnea on exertion, stating that he could walk 1+ miles one week ago, but could only manage 1/4 mile today.  He sleeps on two pillows with no changes, and he denies LE edema.  His anginal equivalent includes jaw and neck pain and mild substernal chest pressure without radiation to his arms; he states his current symptoms are not consistent with his angina.  



He called Dr. Upham, his cardiologist, and was told to increase his Lasix frequence to 20 mg BID.  He was encouraged to come to the SSH ED for his symptoms given his history of CAD (below).  On arrival, the vital signs were T 96.7, P 71, BP 166/81, RR 18, Sat 97% RA.  He had negative kiosk biomarkers and no EKG changes.  He received NTG x3 without much relief and ASA at home.
