                     GLENN HELEN EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT
 
VINCENT,ROBERTA J.   380-18-32-2                    VISIT DATE: 03/31/98
See primarily by Dr. Ulises Collier.  I also saw the patient and 
reviewed Dr. Collier's history. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 62 year-old woman comes from 
dial where she developed substernal chest pain radiating to her 
left arm near the end of the run.  She also complains of shortness 
of breath.  She noted some nausea, but no vomiting.  She had no 
other related symptoms.  She has had no previous history of chest 
pain.  She was given Nitroglycerin x 3 and this eventually relieved 
her pain. 
PAST MEDICAL/SURGICAL HISTORY:  Includes end-stage renal disease, 
coronary artery disease with a bypass graft but without any chest 
pain at the time, and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus which may 
account for her previous cardiac history without chest pain. 
ALLERGIES:  PENICILLIN AND CODEINE 
MEDICATIONS:  Aspirin and Xanax. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Blood pressure 164/94, pulse 
94, respirations 24, oxygen saturation 96%.  GENERAL:  The patient 
is comfortable in no acute distress.  HEAD AND NECK: 
Normocephalic, atraumatic.  Pupils equal and reactive. Pharynx 
benign.  Tongue is of normal shape and contour.  Neck is supple. 
No jugular venous distention.  LUNGS:  Are clear bilaterally. 
CARDIAC:  Regular rate and rhythm.  S1, S2, with no murmurs, rubs 
or gallops.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and non-tender with normal bowel 
sounds.  EXTREMITIES:  No clubbing, cyanosis or edema or rash. 
NEUROLOGICAL:  Patient is alert and oriented x 3.  She moves all 
extremities.  Has symmetrical strength and all proximal and distal 
upper and lower motor bilaterally.  Normal sensation to light touch 
grossly. 
LABORATORY:  White blood cell count 9, hematocrit 41.  Glucose was 
high at 533.  However, she has bicarbonate of 24, so she is 
probably not in diabetic ketoacidosis.  BUN 31, creatinine 3.8. 
Troponin-I was 0.5.  Chest x-ray was negative.  Electrocardiogram 
shows normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and 
non-specific ST/T wave changes.  Perhaps some ST depressions in II, 
III and AVF, and deep S waves in V1, 2, 3, and 4. 
TREATMENT RENDERED AND COURSE IN ED: In the hospital the patient 
did not have further chest pain here.  She was admitted for chest 
pain and for rule out myocardial infarction to the Medical Service. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out myocardial infarction 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Admitted.
