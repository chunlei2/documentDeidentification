Personal data and overall health

			

  This is a 63-year-old man status post renal cell CA and coronary artery disease.



Reason for visit

			

  Followup multiple medical problems.



Major Problems





Coronary artery disease

The patient had recatheterization in May demonstrating 30% stenosis at the stent on the LAD.  He has diffuse disease, otherwise with good collateralization.  His exercise tolerance test in May showed excellent exercise tolerance, but positive images and positive tracings for ischemia.  His Duke ETT score was -10, but his perfusion images showed moderate reversibility in the inferior myocardium with fixed defect anteriorly.  He had infero-apical hypokinesis with an EF of 45%.  It is also noted that his blood pressure fell, but normalized during exercise.  The patient has been stable until last several weeks when he has noted some lower jaw symptoms anteriorly.  He has no chest squeezing, neck squeezing, or jaw pain, but there is an odd sensation under the front teeth.  He correlates this with exercise, but not consistently.  He also occasionally feels this at rest.  He is able to walk uphill and generate a pulse of 90.  He is working doing heavy labor in the garden, moving, and digging.  It is not clear that this represents angina, but we will let Dr. Null know.  He is seeing Dr. Null in three to four weeks.     01/13/2072: .  The patient has been improving steadily since his last admission for CABG in November 2070.  He states his exercise tolerance is steadily improving and he is able to walk 2 miles at a rate of 17 minutes per mile without dyspnea or fatigue.  He has no chest pain or palpitations.  He does worry about bradycardia and states his metoprolol of 50 mg BID may be too much.  He has been withholding half to full dose in the evenings when he finds his pulses about 50.  He has no symptoms of forgetfulness, dizziness, or loss of consciousness.  He does have cold extremities.  There is no weight gain, weight loss, or orthopnea.  He remains on beta blocker, lipitor, Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, digoxin, and warfarin.  He is no longer on Plavix.  He has no nitrate.  On exam, he is somewhat hypertensive, but lungs are good and there is no elevated JVP.  His EKG shows first-degree AV block and I have asked him to bring that to Dr.  Null's office today.  

A: Stable. 

P: Continue medicines as they are because of borderline blood pressure today.  We would not escalate



Elevated blood pressure

The patient is on Diovan, hydrochlorothiazide, and metoprolol.  He states his blood pressure at home is usually quite good and he feels it is responsive to external stressors.  I have asked him to think hard about removing those stressors from his life in order to maintain health.



Hyperlipidemia

The patient remains on 40 mg of lipitor.  It has been a year since we have checked his excellent results and we will check today.  He has been fasting for 12 hours.



Iron deficiency anemia

We will recheck his indices today.  He is not fatigued or pale.



Renal carcinoma

The patient had repeat MRI and CT in January at the Healthwin Hospital.  These were read as stable and he needs no intervention other than continued monitoring at six-month intervals.  He is quite reassured by this.



Seborrheic keratosis

The patient is ready for evaluation by Dermatology.  He has several atypical-looking keratoses as well as poorly rounded lesions consistent with BCCs.  I have referred him to Dermatology today.



Sinus congestion
