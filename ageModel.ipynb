      "On the next morning , however , a computerized tomography scan revealed recurrent hemorrhage with obliteration of her cisterns .\n",
      "She was awake and following commands .\n",
      "It was necessary , however , to return to the operating room for re-evacuation of her hematoma , which was performed .\n",
      "The patient 's postoperative course was remarkably benign given the patient 's age and past medical history .\n",
      "The patient was then extubated on the fifth postoperative day .\n",
      "She did develop some respiratory distress on the first day post-extubation , requiring 48 hours of re-intubation .\n",
      "Her subsequent course from a respiratory standpoint has been relatively unremarkable .\n",
      "In addition , the patient has done very well from a neurological standpoint .\n",
      "She is very bright , alert and oriented x three with an essentially normal neurological examination except for some bilateral dysmetria .\n",
      "She has been tolerating a regular diet and has been working with physical therapy towards ambulation .\n",
      "On 10-28-93 , the patient 's course was complicated by the development of a left lower extremity deep venous thrombosis .\n",
      "She had been maintained on subcutaneous heparin and pneumoboots initially postoperatively and developed her thrombosis in this setting .\n",
      "Since that time , she has been maintained on bedrest and Coumadinized .\n",
      "Her current prothrombin time on 11-3-93 was 14.8 and it is felt that she could begin to be mobilized to a chair .\n",
      "Her prothrombin time should be followed in rehabilitation to maintain it at the level of 14-16 .\n",

      "This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .\n",
      "Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\n",
      "He was extubated on postoperative day number one .\n",
      "His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\n",
      "He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\n",
      "He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\n",
      "He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\n",
      "On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\n",
      "He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\n",
      "A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\n",
      "A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\n",
      "A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\n",
      "He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\n",
      "He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\n",
      "A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\n",
      "Because of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\n",
      "He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\n",
      "Prior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\n",
      "After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\n",
      "It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\n",
      "His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\n",
      "His lumbar drain was removed after five days .\n",
      "He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\n",
      "He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .\n",

      "Dear Dr. Overman: \n",
      "I had the pleasure of seeing your patient, Wendell Urquhart, in consultation today. The patient presents complaining of lower back pain with right lower extremity radiation. He develop symptoms gradually three months ago with no history of preceding trauma. The symptoms became progressively worse. The patient has a history of lower back injury 30 years ago in a motor vehicle accident - at that time he was diagnosed with disc rupture. Currently the pain is intermittent and occurs daily. He grades the intensity of the pain as up to 7 to 8 out of 10 on the numerical pain scale. He describes it as sharp shooting sensation in the lower back with radiation all the way down right lower extremity to the foot. The symptoms are worse with standing; better with sitting and lying down. There is no change in the intensity of symptoms with coughing or sneezing.

      "I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in followup of her coronary artery disease (CABG in October 2078), hypertension, and heart failure.  Since increasing her Lasix dose approximately 12 months ago, she has had substantial improvement in her heart failure symptoms.  She continues to admit to fatigue and musculoskeletal pain as limiting her exertion, but no longer experiences significant dyspnea.  She denies orthopnea, PND, or ankle edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., Lasix 60 mg p.o. q.d., glipizide 10 mg p.o. q.d., losartan 100 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 100 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Avandia, and multivitamins.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Her blood pressure today is 165/70 and her heart rate is in the low 60s.  She is comfortable seated on the exam table.  Her jugular venous pressure is approximately 8 cm with prominent V waves.  There are very rare crackles at the bases.  Cardiac exam reveals a nondisplaced PMI with regular rate and rhythm, normal intensity S1 and S2.  P2 is increased.  There is a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, loudest at the apex.  She has no edema of the extremities and they are warm to touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm with normal axis intervals.  There is nonspecific ST abnormality, unchanged from her tracing in August.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, Ms. Yerger remains free of recurrent angina or heart failure symptoms.  She does have evident persistent elevated right cardiac pressures on exam that may be related to her underlying pulmonary disease.  In light of her systolic hypertension, we increased her Toprol to 150 mg p.o. q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked in the coming week and call the result to me.\n",

      "Dear Dr. Umali:\n",
      "\n",
      "Just a quick note to let you know that I saw Larry Lockwood in followup today.  Mr. Lockwood has been generally feeling well and has no complaints except ongoing left lower extremity edema in the foot only, which is unchanged times many years.  He has otherwise been feeling relatively well.  He continues to be followed by Dr. Aguilera who prefers to take a conservative approach given the difficulty of performing a bone marrow biopsy and low levels of IgA paraprotein.\n",
      "\n",
      "Review of systems is negative except as above.  Fingersticks remain well controlled in the range of 80-150s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Interval family, social, and medical history are unchanged.\n",
      "\n",
      "Current Medications:  Include lisinopril 20 once a day, Proscar 5 once a day, Flomax, aspirin 325 once a day, atenolol 25 once a day, trazodone, folate, MVI, saw palmetto, glucosamine, selenium, vitamin C and vitamin D, Lipitor 20 mg once a day, and Plavix 75 once a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical Exam:  Well-developed, obese in no apparent distress.  BP 169/83 and pulse 58.  Neck:  Supple without JVP or lymphadenopathy.  Chest:  Clear to auscultation and percussion.  Cardiovascular exam:  S1 and S2 without murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Extremities:  No edema, warm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Laboratory Data:  Recent BUN and creatinine 18 and 1.5.  Repeat labs will be done when he comes in next week for his routine labs at the SCH.  Skeletal films are pending.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression:  Mr. Lockwood chronic kidney disease appears to be stable, as I have mentioned before, he most likely has some underlying diabetic and/or hypertensive nephropathy, but I continue to wonder whether the IgA paraprotein is playing a role in the increasing proteinuria and mild CKD. Chemotherapy would be indicated if that were the case..  He is being followed conservatively by Dr. Aguilera thus far in the absence of defniitive data.  I have ordered skull and hip films today to look for evidence of myeloma-related bone disease, which if present could distinguish  more significant disease from MGUS.  I  agree with Dr. Altman  that in the absence of definitive data,as long as creatinine is improving and urinary protein levels remain stable  the current approach is  reasonable.  However, we should have a low threshold for pushing Mr. Lockwood to having either a renal or more preferably bone marrow biopsy.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the meantime because he continues to have protein and albumin in his urine, I have initiated dual angiotensin blockade and have added Cozaar 25 mg a day to his regimen.  He will follow up with me in four months and will have labs next week at the SCH.  Thank you for referring this patient.\n",

      "In addition , Mr. State has an anterior mediastinal mass 2x2x1.7 cm. by recent computerized tomography scan without surrounding or adjacent adenopathy or parenchymal lung disease apart from bronchiectasis .\n",
      "His cardiomyopathy work up entailed a negative ANA , negative SPEP , UPEP and Benz-Jones proteins , normal ferritin , thyroid stimulating hormone and a recent work up for possible bimomatous associated myasthenia gravis that was negative .\n",
      "The patient lives on Quelene with his wife .\n",

      "Notable for a sodium of 145 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 23 , creatinine 1.3 , glucose 104 , hematocrit 42 , white count 8.7 , platelet count 235 and a PT of 12.9 seconds .\n",
      "The urinalysis was negative .\n",
      "The Troponin I was less than .4 and the creatine kinase was 114 .\n",
      "Chest x-ray revealed moderate cardiomegaly with no clear interstitial or alveolar pulmonary edema and chronic atelectasis and / or scarring at both lung bases .\n",
      "The electrocardiogram revealed normal sinus rhythm with premature atrial complexes and right bundle branch block with left anterior hemiblock and old anterior myocardial infarction .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Hospital and underwent an approximate 1.5 liter diuresis within the first 24 hours with improvement in his symptoms and improvement in his oxygen saturations .\n",
      "After a long discussion with the patient and his family it was determined that a cardiac catheterization would be prudent .\n",
      "Prior to catheterization a VQ scan was performed which revealed a moderate probability for PE with a subsegmental defect in the lingular on the left lung .\n",
      "Subsequent lower extremities noninvasive studies and D-dimer test were both negative rendering the probability of acute pulmonary embolism less than 2 percent .\n",
      "It was not felt that the patient would be in need of chronic Coumadin therapy in lieu of this low probability findings in toto .\n",

      "After a approximate 3 liter total diuresis the right atrial pressure was 5 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure 14 , pulmonary vacuolar resistance 353 and the cardiac output depressed at 2.95 liters per minute , or a cardiac index of 1.7 liters per minute .\n",
      "Based upon these findings it was felt that Mr. State most likely has multi-factorial dyspnea owing to both his ventilatory limitation and to a chronic low output state .\n",
      "In Hospital he was seen by both Speech Therapy , physical therapy , and the Uspend Harmemewood Medical Center Congestive Heart Failure Nurse Practitioner Program .\n",
      "His Isordil was increased in Hospital and blood pressure control was relative episodic with systolic pressures ranging between 100 and 160 .\n",
      "Future adjustments will be made at home pending his blood pressure measures .\n",
      "At a goal weight of 142 pounds , Mr. State 's filling pressures appeared ideal with a wedge pressure of 14 and his goal weight range will be between 142 and 44 pounds at home .\n",
      "The patient will be followed by Dr. State within a week of discharge and by Nieie Naebrand Freierm of the Dyathenslycha Medical Center .\n",

      "\n",
      "I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in\n",
      "follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.  At her last visit her\n",
      "heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and\n",
      "her Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been\n",
      "feeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. \n",
      "She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  \n",
      "\n",
      "Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg\n",
      "PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.\n",
      "day, Avandia, and multivitamins.\n",
      "\n",
      "On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. \n",
      "She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. \n",
      "Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a\n",
      "non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur\n",
      "at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal\n",
      "border.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.\n",
      "\n",
      "Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are\n",
      "nonspecific ST abnormalities.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She\n",
      "has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected\n",
      "to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg\n",
      "PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.  \n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "The patient was diagnosed with ovarian carcinoma in the summer of 1992 when she presented with abdominal distention .\n",
      "At that time she was taken to the operating room and an ileostomy and colectomy performed .\n",
      "The admission was complicated by the development of a right calf deep venous thrombosis on postoperative day four .\n",
      "The patient was referred then to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital where she underwent thrombectomy .\n",
      "One month later the patient was readmitted to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for definitive debulking including total abdominal hysterectomy , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy , omentectomy , splenectomy and ileostomy take-down by Dr. Slaineaee Chabechird .\n",
      "Thereafter she underwent line 1 chemotherapy with cis platinum , VP16 which she received six cycles and which was completed in March of 1993 .\n",
      "This course of chemotherapy was complicated only by persistent diarrhea and some nausea and vomiting .\n",
      "On 4/28/94 the patient developed a left femoral deep venous thrombosis requiring admission for anticoagulation .\n",
      "An abdominopelvic computerized tomography scan during that admission showed recurrent disease in the pelvis with bilateral hydronephrosis .\n",
      "Bilateral ureteric stents were placed prior to discharge .\n",
      "Two days following discharge , however , the patient was admitted to Sephsandpot Center because of a decreased urinary output and persistent nausea and vomiting and anorexia .\n",
      "She was maintained on intravenous fluids and received a transfusion of Prilosec which helped her urinary obstruction .\n",
      "On this regimen she showed good improvement and was discharge home .\n",
      "She was then seen on 5/30/94 at Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital for a routine chemotherapy but complained of decreased urinary output , nausea and vomiting and poor appetite and was therefore admitted .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "Is as detailed above .\n",
      "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "She is also status post appendectomy in 1944 and dilation and curettage in 1945 .\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "( on admission ) showed the patient to be low-grade febrile with temperature of 99.6 , vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 104/68 and a pulse of 92 , respiratory rate 16 .\n",
      "She was noted to be a thin , cachectic woman in no apparent distress .\n",
      "Head and neck examination remarkable only for extreme dry mucous membranes consistent with dehydration .\n",
      "She had slightly icteric sclera , no adenopathy or thyromegaly .\n",
      "Lungs examination was unremarkable with no focal pathology , breasts were within normal limits .\n",
      "Heart :\n",
      "regular rate and rhythm , no evidence of evidence , cardiac failure or endocarditis .\n",
      "Abdomen :\n",
      "showed well healed midline scar , non-distended , non-tender , bowel sounds were good , multiple small nodules were palpated subcutaneously in the upper abdomen which was non-tender , there was no costovertebral angle tenderness .\n",
      "Pelvic and rectal examinations confirmed recurrence of tumor mass in the pelvis .\n",
      "The patient was occult blood negative .\n",
      "Extremities :\n",
      "showed no evidence of acute deep venous thrombosis .\n",
      "However , left leg had two plus pitting edema to the knee whereas the right leg had minimal edema .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "( on admission ) showed sodium 119 , potassium 9.8 ( the specimen was hemolyzed ) BUN and creatinine of 26 and 2.3 respectively , glucose 104 , ALT was 13 , total bilirubin .5 , alkaline phosphatase 62 , white blood cell count was 17.7 , hematocrit 26.7 , platelet count 223,000 , prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time were 22.1 and 37 respectively .\n",
      "I and R was 5.2. Urinalysis showed no white blood cells and few bacteria .\n",
      "Chest x-ray from 5/18/94 was within normal limits .\n",
      "IN SUMMARY :\n",
      "The patient was assessed as a 72 year old woman with a background of stage IIIC ovarian carcinoma and documented local recurrence who presents for line 2 of cycle 1 chemotherapy with Adriamycin , Ifex and MESNA .\n",
      "She also has a low-grade fever of unknown etiology , has a background history of deep venous thrombosis and is therefore currently on anticoagulation and she shows evidence of dehydration and failure to thrive .\n",
      "It was decided at that time to hold off with the chemotherapy .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was therefore admitted to the GYN / Oncology Service under the care of Dr. Chabechird .\n",
      "Laboratory tests were repeated in view of some of the above abnormalities and was remarkable for sodium 138 , potassium 4.0 , BUN and creatinine remained elevated at 36 and 2.8 respectively .\n",
      "Urinalysis showed 10-20 white blood cells .\n",
      "In view of the nausea and vomiting a nasogastric tube was placed to which the patient some relief .\n",
      "Repeat chest x-ray showed evidence of right lower lobe pneumonia .\n",
      "Renal ultrasound was performed which showed moderate right and severe left hydronephrosis , bilateral ureteric stents were visualized .\n",
      "Dr. Ryna R. Jescdrig from the Urology Service was consulted in view of the above findings .\n",
      "He requested a Lasix renal nuclear medicine scan which showed high-grade obstruction of both kidneys , left greater than right and minimal clearance with Lasix .\n",
      "Neither kidney appeared to be completely obstructed .\n",
      "In view of these results with the elevated white blood count , elevated creatinine , Dr. Jescdrig felt that the patient was inadequately stented .\n",
      "As a result she was taken back to the operating room on 6/2/94 and under cystoscopy the old stents were removed and new larger stents were placed .\n",
      "The patient was started on Ampicillin and Gentamicin for urinary tract infection which ultimately grew out Escherichia coli sensitive to the above antibiotics and for right lower lobe pneumonia on x-ray .\n",
      "She was started on nebulizers around-the-clock and chest physical therapy .\n",
      "Sputum culture was sent but failed to identify an infective organism .\n",
      "On the above regimen the patient showed marked improvement .\n",
      "Her urinary output remained good at 80-100 ccs. per hour .\n",
      "However , her BUN and creatinine remained elevated .\n",
      "On 6/5/94 they were 21 and 2.2 respectively .\n",
      "Her Coumadin anticoagulation was adjusted to give a prothrombin time between 16 and 18 and an I and R of 2.5-3 .\n",
      "On June 5 , 1994 it was decided that Mrs. Neathe was not stable enough with a line 2 cycle I chemotherapy with Ifex , Adriamycin and MESNA .\n",
      "She was therefore well hydrated and was started on her chemotherapy .\n",
      "In view of her kidney damage it was suggested to change her intravenous antibiotics from Ancef and Gentamicin to Ancef and ciprofloxacin which she tolerated well .\n",
      "On 6/7/94 the patient was found to be mildly confused with persistent nausea and malaise .\n",
      "Urinary electrolytes were noted to be within normal limits but her confusion persisted .\n",
      "A Neuro-Oncology consult was sought which felt this was probably secondary to Ifex intoxication and her chemotherapy was stopped .\n",
      "An electroencephalogram was requested and was negative .\n",
      "No computerized tomography scan or magnetic resonance imaging study of the head was performed .\n",
      "She continued to have persistent nausea and vomiting with large amount of drainage through the nasogastric tube between 1200 and 1500 ccs. for 24 hours .\n",
      "Off her Ifex the patient 's sensorium slowly cleared but the nausea and vomiting persisted .\n",
      "For this reason a barium study was performed on 6/12/94 which showed a fixed stricture at the anastomosis of the descending colon with the rectum .\n",
      "The mucosa appeared to be preserved .\n",
      "In addition there was some narrowing in the mid portion of the descending colon .\n",
      "The patient 's white blood count which had been followed carefully began to drop precipitously on 6/11/94 and nadired down to 0.7 on 6/12/94 .\n",
      "The patient was placed on neutropenic precautions , her intravenous antibiotics were continued .\n",
      "Her sensorium had cleared .\n",

      "not repeat her history as you know it well. Over the past three\n",
      "months Mrs. Vincent has complained of increasing fatigue,\n",
      "occasionally sleeping more than 12 hours per night, forgetfulness\n",
      "and tingling of the fingers and toes. She has maintained a\n",
      "relatively good appetite and denies nausea, vomiting or shortness\n",
      "of breath.  An Iothalamate GFR test obtained on December 14, 2092\n",
      "revealed a glomerular infiltration rate of approximately 10 ml per\n",
      "minute, suggesting profound loss of renal function.\n",
      " \n",
      "On physical examination today her weight is 99.5 kilograms or 219\n",
      "pounds.  Blood pressure is 150/90, pulse is 80 and regular.  The\n",
      "lungs are clear. There is no peripheral edema. Again, there marked\n",
      "cushingoid features. Despite overall weight loss, Mrs. Vincent\n",
      "comments that she has gained facial and abdominal fat as well as\n",
      "facial hair over the past several months.\n",
      " \n",
      "In summary, Mrs. Vincent appears to be developing early symptoms of\n",
      "uremia.  Given her advanced azotemia we believe that she should\n",
      "undergo creation of an arteriovenous fistula so that she may start\n",
      "dialysis within the next several months. We have arranged to\n",
      "recheck her chemistries today.  We would also recommend that she\n",

      "Oxygen saturations at this time were greater than 90% on 100% breather .\n",
      "The patient was intubated and prior to intubation his rhythm was noted to be in the low junctional vs. accelerated idioventricular pattern .\n",
      "Surgery at this time was consulted and it was decided that the patient was not an operable candidate so the decision was made not to place an intra-aortic balloon pump .\n",
      "Central access was gained and a chest x-ray was done which showed no pnuemothorax and his central line was in good placement as well as NG tube .\n",
      "He was still in some CHF , mild to moderate .\n",
      "Atropine one amp was given .\n",
      "At this time the decision to cardiovert the patient was made and he was cardioverted at 40 joules without significant change .\n",
      "There was a question of fleeting T waves that were noted briefly but could not be observed on 12 lead EKG .\n",
      "At this time 1 mg of Glucagon IV was given in the hopes of reversing any remnant of beta blocker effect and a pacer wire was introduced through the central access with only fleeting capture .\n",
      "At this point , the blood pressure continued to fall and the patient was no longer responsive .\n",
      "The rhythm began to degenerate into an agonal rhythm and a code was finally called at 9:18 p.m.\n",
      "The patient was without respirations or blood pressure .\n",

      "Mr. William Le return for follow-up in the Neurology clinic today.  He still has significant difficulty walking, and he is falling frequently at home. He has not sustained any significant injuries.  He has numbness and paresthesias of his feet, but there has been no interval change in his symptoms since his last visit in November 2162.\n",

      "\n",

      "Examination:  reveals that strength testing in the legs is normal.  He has absent deep tendon reflexes of the ankles, trace to 1+ at the knees.  Romberg's test is positive, and the patient has difficulty standing without assistance.  Despite the degree of sensory ataxia, he is still able to feel position sense at the metatarsophalangeal joints in his feet. Vibration and pinprick sensation are diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Data Review:  The patient does have a persistent low concentration of monoclonal protein in the slow gamma region.  This is unchanged compared to the previous study done in February 2162. This most likely is a MGUS.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression and Recommendation:  The patient has poorly controlled diabetes, complicated by polyneuropathy.  The monoclonal protein is an incidental finding and is probably not accounting for his peripheral neuropathy.  Given that the monoclonal protein has not changed in concentration or character I do not believe that there is a need for additional testing at this stage.  He will continue with Neurontin to manage his neuropathic symptoms.  I have urged him to try and maintain good diabetic control. Follow-up in 6 months\n",

      "Chest X-Ray showed hyperinflation bilaterally and loss of the anterior clear space on the lateral film likely secondary to arm position since the patient was unable to raise up her arm from weakness stemming from her multiple sclerosis .\n",
      "EKG showed baseline artifacts , sinus tachycardia at l05 , PR interval of 0.l6 , QRS of 0.08 , QT of 0.36 , an axis of 60 degrees , poor R wave progression with transition after the V4 lead , T wave flattening in II and F , and T wave inversion in III .\n",
      "No old EKG was available for comparison .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "1) Multiple sclerosis - The patient underwent lumbar puncture which revealed a glucose of 73 , a protein of 38 , positive oligoclonal bands with an IgG to albumin ratio of 0.485 .\n",
      "Cell count was l white cell and 5l red cells with a differential of 90 lymphocytes and l0 monocytes in tube number four and two white cells and 600 red cells with a differential of 5 polys , 90 lymphocytes , and 5 monocytes in tube number one .\n",
      "Patient also had an MRI scan of the head which showed a lesion in the left pons consistent with multiple sclerosis .\n",
      "Serum IgG was elevated at l,520 .\n",
      "SPEP showed an elevated gamma spike of l.83 and was otherwise within normal limits .\n",
      "The patient underwent Lenti Pidesrah Non Community Hospital multiple sclerosis treatment , group II protocol with Cytoxan and ACTH induction with the plan for maintenance Methylprednisolone after discharge .\n",
      "She tolerated the protocol medications well except for some nausea and vomiting which was relatively well controlled with anti-emetic medication and also some very mild hematuria to the tune of 20 to 25 red blood cells on micro .\n",
      "This was , in fact , consistent with the fact that she had an indwelling Foley placed on admission after post-void residual was noted to be 200 cc of urine .\n",
      "She received Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy during the hospitalization .\n",
      "2) Anemia - Patient had a steady drop in hematocrit from the admission value of 43.5 to the range of about 3l by hospital day number eight which remained stable at this point .\n",
      "She had guaiac negative stools , no menses , no significant hematuria , and no signs of hemolysis .\n",
      "Work-up included an iron of l24 , TIBC of 207 , a ferritin of l24 , and Bl2 and folate were pending but unlikely to be contributing to this acute drop .\n",
      "Haptoglobin was l79 with a normal bilirubin and a normal LDH .\n",
      "Glucose was 6 , phosphate deficiency was checked with a normal level of 25 being measured , and reticulocyte count of less than 0.l% was noted at one point with follow-up reticulocyte count of 0.l% noted on the day prior to discharge .\n",
      "This was felt to be consistent with decreased bone marrow production of new red cells and possibly a hematocrit drop secondary to in-hospital phlebotomy with some dilutional component secondary to intravenous and p.o. hydration .\n",
      "Patient did not show coincident decrease in white count or platelet count .\n",
      "A clot was sent to the Blood Bank , however , the patient did not require a transfusion .\n",
      "She did receive Bactrim for a urinary tract infection and this medication was discontinued given its potential for aplasia in the bone marrow .\n",
      "Patient will be followed up with subsequent CBC on the September , the September , the September , and the Septemberth of 2006 to assure that her hematocrit recovers .\n",
      "3) Urinary tract infection - Patient had too numerous to count white cells on urinalysis on 08/15/90 and was thus begun on Bactrim DS one tablet p.o. b.i.d.\n",
      "Subsequently , urine culture prior to initiation of antibiotic therapy grew out pan sensitive E. coli , greater than l00,000 including sensitivities to Bactrim .\n",
      "Patient received a seven day course of Bactrim DS one tablet b.i.d. with resolution of symptoms and subsequent negative culture .\n",
      "Her Foley will be discontinued at discharge and she will continue home straight catheterizations given her post-void residual of 200 cc on admission per the visiting nurse .\n",

      "CHIEF COMPLAINT :\n",
      "Cean Leach is a 38 year old male who is admitted in transfer from the Morehegron Valley Hospital in Ville , Virginia for further evaluation and management of accelerating chest pains syndrome .\n",
      "Mr. Leach has a long and complex history of coronary artery disease .\n",
      "He was without known cardiovascular illness until he suffered an acute anterior myocardial infarction in August of l988 .\n",
      "He was treated at that time with TPA .\n",
      "A subsequent cardiac catheterization revealed a 90% lesion in his proximal left anterior descending coronary artery and minor disease elsewhere in his coronary distribution .\n",
      "His ejection fraction was in the mid-50's.\n",
      "Because of angina following that catheterization , he ultimately underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of his left anterior descending coronary artery .\n",
      "He did well until he developed recurrent angina in March of l991 at which time repeat catheterization demonstrated restenosis of his left anterior descending and he underwent a second PTCA with good results .\n",
      "He again did well until approximately late l992 .\n",
      "Since that time , he has had multiple admissions to George'sdgot Medical Center with recurrent chest pain .\n",
      "He has ruled in for small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on many but not all of these occasions .\n",
      "He has had a progressive decline in his left ventricular ejection fraction as measured by non-invasive means with an echo ejection fraction in the low 40's and radionuclide ejection fraction estimated in August of l994 at 31% .\n",
      "He was admitted to George'sdgot Medical Center with a typical episode of this discomfort in October of l994 .\n",
      "He was transferred at that time to the Ph University Of Medical Center .\n",
      "That was his first Ph University Of Medical Center admission .\n",
      "Because of Mr. Leach 's history and the fact that multiple cardiac catheterizations prior to that transfer had failed to demonstrate fixed epicardial coronary disease , it was decided that he should undergo provocative testing to evaluate whether or not he had coronary artery spasm and / or impaired coronary flow reserve .\n",
      "His angiograms from Morehegron Valley Hospital from his four prior catheterizations were reviewed and the patient was gradually tapered off all of his vasoactive medications .\n",
      "He was taken to the Catheter Laboratory on October 13 , 1994 .\n",
      "There he had a right heart catheterization with unremarkable intercardiac pressures .\n",
      "Repeat coronary angiography once again failed to demonstrate any significant obstructive lesions in either his dominant right coronary artery or his left coronary system .\n",
      "He then underwent a Doppler Coronary Flow study which demonstrated impaired coronary flow reserve .\n",
      "Specifically , his coronary flow maximally increased by a factor of 2-2.5 whereas a normal response is considered to a 3-4 fold increasing in coronary flow to maximal stimulus .\n",
      "Following the coronary flow studies , he was given greater doses of intracoronary ergonovine to assess his susceptibility to coronary artery spasm .\n",
      "He had a normal response to ergonovine that is he had diffuse narrowing of his coronary arteries without induction of focal spasm .\n",
      "However , he did develop typical anginal discomfort which was easily reversed with intracoronary nitroglycerin .\n",
      "It was felt that the time that this study was most consistent with a syndrome of impaired coronary flow reserve or microvascular angina .\n",
      "He was treated with increasing doses of two calcium channel blockers and gradually ambulated in the hall without discomfort and was discharged to home .\n",
      "Following that admission in October he had a symptom free interval which lasted a couple of months .\n",
      "Starting in the October of l994 , he once again started having recurrences of his typical anginal discomfort .\n",
      "This occurred at rest and with exercise .\n",
      "He had multiple admissions to the Morehegron Valley Hospital once again ruling in for a small R Q wave myocardial infarctions on a number of these occasions .\n",
      "His medications were adjusted many times without adequate interruption of the pattern of increasingly frequent and increasingly severe episodes of pain .\n",
      "His most recent admission to the Morehegron Valley Hospital is on April 5 , of 1994 .\n",
      "He had a prolonged episode of typical anginal pain and rule in for a small Q wave myocardial infarction .\n",
      "Because of the refractory nature of his chest pain and the failure of multiple drug combinations to control his symptoms , he was transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center on 4-9-94 .\n",
      "His medications that had been used individually or in combination include beta blockers and Lodapine cardiazem , nifidepine and coumadin , aspirin , cyclopadine and seratonin antagonists .\n",
      "There is no history of drug abuse or smoking .\n",
      "Of note , his brother had a myocardial infarction in his late 20's .\n",
      "There is no other family history of premature coronary disease or history of stroke or deep venous thrombosis suggestive of hypercoaguable state .\n",
      "Of note , his prior work-up has also included screening test for hypercoaguability with normal levels of protein S and C and an unrevealing right ventricular under myocardial biopsy .\n",
      "His medications on admission included Isordil , Lovastatin , aspirin , heparin and Lodapine , Cardizem and Lasix .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "He looked generally well .\n",
      "His blood pressure l60/90 .\n",
      "His heart rate was 88 .\n",
      "His jugular venous pressure was normal .\n",
      "His chest was clear and his carotids were brisk and his cardiac examination revealed a soft systolic flow murmur .\n",
      "His abdomen was obese with no palpable organomegaly .\n",
      "His femoral pulses were l+ and equal without bruits .\n",
      "He had trace peripheral edema and excellent peripheral pulses .\n",
      "His initial laboratory values included a sodium of l38 .\n",
      "Potassium of 3.2 .\n",
      "Normal chloride and CO2 .\n",
      "His BUN was 12 and his creatinine was 1.1 .\n",
      "Glucose was l55 although subsequent determinations were normal .\n",
      "His fasting cholesterol was 174 with an HDL of 35 and an LDH of 97 .\n",
      "His liver function tests were normal with the exception of his LDH which was mildly elevated to 222 .\n",
      "His hematocrit was approximately 39 with an unremarkable differential and normal platelet count .\n",
      "His sedimentation rate was 32 and was 40 on repeat testing .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "the primary concern upon Mr. Leach 's transfer was that despite the fact that he had multiple previous catheterizations over the prior two years that he may have redeveloped obstructive coronary artery disease .\n",
      "It was ; therefore , felt appropriate to start his repeat work-up by repeating his cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography .\n",
      "To that end , he was taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory on 4-10-94 , there he underwent right and left heart catheterization , coronary angiography and left ventriculography .\n",
      "The right heart catheter which was done using a Swanz Ganz catheter advanced to 8 French sheath and right femoral vein revealed a mean right atrial pressure 3 mm of mercury and a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 12 mm of mercury .\n",
      "The left ventricular pressure was l05/12 .\n",
      "Coronary angiography revealed a picture which was essentially unchanged from October of l994 .\n",
      "That is there was no obstructive large vessel or coronary artery disease although there were some diffuse luminal irregularities .\n",
      "Left ventriculography revealed a large area of antero lateral and apical hypokinesis to akinesis with an estimated ejection fraction of 35% .\n",
      "Impression at the time of his catheterization was that the precise etiology of his chest pain remained rather enigmatic .\n",
      "He was ; therefore , seen in consultation by Dr. Lato Tikfreierm of the Hematology Service to evaluate him further for a possible hypocoagulable condition versus primary and secondary platelet abnormality which could explain his recurrent coronary events .\n",
      "After an extensive evaluation including in vitro testing and flow cytometry of Mr. Leach 's platelets , it was ultimately determined that he did in fact have a primary platelet defect .\n",
      "Specifically , his platelets were not affected by aspirin and showed spontaneous hyperaggragability .\n",
      "This was utilized in making some changes in Mr. Leach 's regiment .\n",
      "Specifically his aspirin was discontinued and he was put back on ticlopidine at a higher than ordinary dose at 500 mg. b.i.d.\n",
      "Repeat in vitro testing of Mr. Leach 's platelets suggested that although they remained refractory to aspirin , they did demonstrate reduced hyperaggragability spontaneously which was felt to be possible reflective of the ticlopidine effect .\n",
      "While in the hospital , Mr. Leach continued to nearly daily episodes of chest pain .\n",
      "These were generally spontaneous in nature and lasted anywhere from several minutes to nearly an hour duration .\n",
      "There were typically improved but not completely eradicated with sublingual nitroglycerin and generally required i.v. narcotics for complete pain relief .\n",
      "Because of the ongoing nature of his pain .\n",
      "Multiple changes and additions were made to his drug regimen .\n",
      "He was tried on theophylline and imipramine without real change in his chest pain syndrome .\n",
      "He was tried on a variety of different combinations of calcium channel blockers including amlodipine and diltiazem and lodipine and verapamil .\n",
      "Amlodipine and bepridil all without marked change in his clinical syndrome .\n",
      "The rest of his hypercoagulable work-up revealed that he had nearly normal levels of clotting factors , specifically , his antithrombin 3 of level was lll with a reference range of 80-120 .\n",
      "Protein C was 85 with a reference range of 70-140 .\n",
      "Protein S was l14 with a reference range of 70-140 .\n",
      "Plasminogen was slightly high at l51 with upper limit of normal being l30 .\n",
      "Factor 8 was likewise slightly high at 249 with a reference range of 50-200 .\n",
      "Thrombin time and repalase time were normal .\n",
      "It was felt that these results were non-specific and may represent just an acute phase reactants .\n",
      "His anti-cardio lipen antibodies both IGM and IGG were within normal range .\n",
      "His APC resistance was normal .\n",
      "He was seen in consultation by both Rheumatology and Endocrinology to evaluate the possibility of primary connective tissue disease an / or possible a theochromocytoma .\n",
      "Rheumatology felt that there was no good evidence of a primary vasculitic process as the source of his presumed small vessell coronary disease and no further rheumatologic work-up was undertaken .\n",
      "He had multiple 24 hour urine tests performed to evaluate the question of theochromocytoma , these demonstrated mild elevations of some urinary catacholomines , but it was felt that this could well represent a reaction to the complex medical regimen that he was having as well as the recurrent episodes of pain themselves .\n",
      "It was not felt that he had good evidence of theochromocytoma .\n",
      "His compliment levels were normal and he had no evidence of hepatitis , B serologies which also measured to see if there was some chronic inflammatory process .\n",
      "Because of the persistent nature of his pain and the inability to control it adequately on constantly changing a quite complex medical regimen , it was suggested that a sympathetic blockade be performed as a method of controlling his chest pain syndrome .\n",
      "To evaluate the efficacy of this prior to commiting him to a permanent blockade procedure , a temporary sympathetic blockade was performed using a local anesthetic and stellate ganglion injection .\n",
      "Prior to performing that an exercise tolerance test was performed on May 13 .\n",
      "That study demonstrated that the patient was able to exercise for ten minutes of a standard protocol and stopped because of fatigue ; although he had no significant ST changes with exercise , he did experience his typical anginal chest discomfort which was ultimately relieved of the combination of sublingual nitroglycerin and i.v. morphine sulfate .\n",
      "On the basis of that test , he underwent stellate block the following day .\n",
      "That was performed in the pain clinic using l% lidocaine to the skin and l0 cc of Bupivacaine under fluoroscopic guidance at the level of T1 .\n",
      "This produced a good sympathetic block with evidence of a rise in temperature in the left arm and ptosis and myosis of the left eye .\n",
      "He was then taken directly from the pain clinic to the exercise laboratory and repeat exercise testing was done .\n",
      "He once again exercised for ten minutes achieved the same rate pressure product and had no chest discomfort .\n",
      "This encouraged his care takers to pursue a more permanent sympathetic blockade .\n",
      "After extended discussions with pain service , Mr. Leach was brought back down to the pain clinic on October 27 .\n",
      "There a catheter was placed at the level of T1 under fluroscopic guidance .\n",
      "Once again Narcaine was injected to induce a sympathetic block .\n",
      "The catheter was left in place for approximately 24 hours with recurrent injections maintained the sympathetic block and during that time he had no recurrent angina .\n",
      "After extensive discussions with the patient , the pain service and thoracic surgery , it was felt appropriate to proceed with a surgical sympathectomy to relieve him of his intractable chest pain syndrome .\n",
      "Therefore , on October 27 , the patient underwent left thorascopic thoracic sympathectomy by Dr. Aalv Sctroi .\n",
      "He tolerated that procedure well and had no recurrent anginal pain throughout the rest of his hospitalization .\n",
      "He had incisional pain which was well-controlled with a combination of Percocet and morphine sulfate and progressively ambulated and was discharged to home in good condition free of recurrent angina on May 27 , 1995 .\n",

      "The patient is a 72 year old male with a history of coronary artery disease .\n",
      "He had experienced three myocardial infarctions since 1988 .\n",
      "He presented with sustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia in December , 1994 and was admitted to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital .\n",
      "The coronary angiogram performed during his hospitalization had revealed 95% of left anterior descending artery disease and diffuse left circumflex disease .\n",
      "An echocardiogram had revealed an ejection fraction of 41% with apicalakinesis .\n",
      "He had undergone electrophysiology study and his incessant ventricular tachycardia was interrupted by transcatheter radio frequency ablation .\n",
      "After the ablation procedure , programmed stimulation had initiated another ventricular tachycardia with distinct surface QRS configuration but since there was no spontaneous ventricular tachycardia , the other forms were not pursued vigorously .\n",
      "The patient was discharged while on procainamide and Coumadin .\n",
      "On March 8 , he developed palpitations with shortness of breath and chest pain .\n",
      "The patient was admitted to an outside hospital in Xingwa Moineswest where a wide complex tachycardia with a rate of 160 beats per minute was demonstrated .\n",
      "The tachycardia had not responded to intravenous lidocaine or procainamide but has responded to intravenous verapamil .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to Tecal Galecounxopt Community Hospital for further evaluation .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "The past medical history is notable for hypertension , left ventricular aneurysm and deep venous thrombosis which he experienced one month ago after the radio frequency ablation .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "On admission physical examination , he was a well developed , well nourished elderly man in slightly dyspneic and uncomfortable condition .\n",
      "His blood pressure was 130/80 millimeters of mercury , and pulse was 80 beats per minute .\n",
      "The carotids were 2+ on both sides with bruits on each side .\n",
      "The jugular venous pressure was 7 centimeters .\n",

      "The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit .\n",
      "The patient continued to experience multiple episodes of sustained and nonsustained monomorphic ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "Intravenous procainamide was started , which reduced the frequency and the duration of the ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "On March 11 , the patient underwent an electrophysiology study .\n",
      "During the study , ventricular tachycardia with a cycle length of 510 milliseconds was reproducibly induced by extra stimuli delivered from the right ventricular apex .\n",
      "Pace mapping studies had demonstrated that the origin of the tachycardia to be in the inferior , lateral and apical left ventricle .\n",
      "After mapping of the tachycardia , radio frequency ablation was carried out with four current applications , terminating the ventricular tachycardia in three of the four times .\n",
      "After radio frequency ablation , no sustained ventricular tachycardias occurred .\n",
      "However , there were periods of supraventricular tachycardias with a rate of 160-180 beats per minute and the patient was placed on sotalol .\n",
      "Since the patient was known to have multiple different ventricular tachycardias , automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy was also offered to the patient .\n",
      "The patient agreed to proceed with automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator therapy .\n",
      "On March 17 , the patient was taken to the Pacemaker Laboratory and a transvenous lead for the automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator ( CPI Endotak C 0074 ) was placed .\n",
      "Then , the patient was transferred to the operating room and a Ventak PRX model 1705 automatic implantable cardiac defibrillator system was implanted .\n",

      "Under brief propafol anesthesia , rapid ventricular tachycardia was induced by ramp pacing .\n",
      "This was properly detected and converted to normal sinus rhythm with a single 34 joule countershock .\n",
      "Three zones were programmed in the cardiac defibrillator .\n",
      "For tachycardias with heart rate between 110 and 140 beats per minute , no therapy was programmed .\n",
      "For tachycardias with heart rates between 140 and 175 , anti-tachycardia pacing followed by cardioversion is programmed .\n",
      "For tachycardias faster than 175 beats per minute , cardioversion and defibrillation was programmed .\n",
      "VVI pacing at 40 beats per minute was also programmed .\n",
      "The patient felt good on the morning of March 20 .\n",
      "The patient was discharged home in stable condition on the regimen described above .\n",

      "Mr. Ocampo returns to the office following his recent coronary artery bypass graft surgery.  As you know, Dr. Todd Banks took him to the operating room on August 17th, at which point, he underwent multivessel bypass surgery with placement of a left internal mammary artery to his LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to his PDA, first obtuse marginal, and second obtuse marginal.  He tolerated the procedure uneventfully.  His postoperative course was notable for intermittent atrial fibrillation for which he was eventually started on amiodarone therapy.  He also had some difficulty with urinary retention and had a Foley placed, which has stayed in since discharge.  He spent approximately 10 days in Gadsden Medical and has now been discharged to home.  Currently, he complains of a variety of musculoskeletal complaints involving his upper chest and left arm; however, he denies symptoms of active angina, congestive failure, or sensed arrhythmias.  He is slowly recovering his overall strength.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last blood studies available to me indicate a random glucose of 118, creatinine of 1.1, normal liver function studies, cholesterol of 124, triglyceride of 124, HDL 39, LDL 60, hematocrit of 33.3.\n",
      "\n",
      "On a regimen of amiodarone 200 mg p.o. q.d., enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. q.d., Niferex 150 mg p.o. q.d., p.r.n. Tylenol No. 3, Hytrin 10 mg p.o. q.d., Proscar 5 mg p.o. q.d., Toprol-XL 50 mg p.o. q.d., Pletal 100 mg p.o. b.i.d., possibly simvastatin at 20 mg p.o. q.d.\n",

      "Physical exam today reveals a pleasant male in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 110/50, heart rate 65 and regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 183 pounds.  The neck is supple, JVP flat, carotids are 2+ without significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with 1/6 systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is benign.  Extremities reveal markedly diminished peripheral pulses and 1+ pedal edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 60, PR interval 0.14, QRS 0.12, QT 0.38, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of left bundle-branch block with secondary ST and T-wave changes.  An echocardiogram performed prior to discharge revealed mildly reduced left ventricular systolic function with a global ejection fraction of 40% at a time when he had a very rapid heart rate.  No subsequent echocardiogram has been performed when he is in sinus rhythm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression and Plan:  Mr. Ocampo is making a slow but study recovery from his multivessel coronary bypass graft surgery.  I suggested he undergo repeat echocardiogram to document current left ventricular function now that he is back in sinus rhythm.  I told him he would stay on amiodarone for approximately 3-6 months, and assuming, he was in normal sinus rhythm throughout this time period, his amiodarone would then be discontinued.  At that time, I would also discontinue his Coumadin.  In addition, at the time of his diagnostic catheterization, he had evidence for severe peripheral vascular disease, and he understands that when he has completed his recovery from his recent surgery, I would strongly encourage further evaluation of his lower extremity arterial system with an eye toward potential percutaneous intervention.  In addition, I have asked him to obtain copies of his discharge summary from the Gadsden Medical Center.  I would like to resume ACE inhibitor therapy in light of his significant CAD and probable left ventricular dysfunction.  He will have routine blood studies obtained today.  I would target his LDL cholesterol to the 70 range.  Beyond this, I have not altered his current regimen.\n",

      "Dear Dr. Colon:\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "I am writing to inform you that I am seeing Mr. Oliver Jain in followup.  Mr. Jain was admitted to my service in transfer for right lower extremity ischemia and gangrene following atheroembolization from a popliteal aneurysm, as you know.  He was admitted in early September and stayed until early October.  During his hospital stay here his wounds were addressed.  He underwent angiograms to evaluate his arterial anatomy and he underwent reconstruction of the right wherein covered stent graft was used to cover disease in his proximal femoral artery and then he underwent an above knee to below knee popliteal artery bypass using PTFE with ligation of the aneurysm.  He also subsequently underwent angioplasty of his posterior tibial artery.  Given his atheroembolic phenomenon he had very limited vasculature remaining in the foot and I was concerned that the forefoot gangrene would progress and he would wind up losing the right foot.  In the interim since his discharge he appears to be doing quite well.  The gangrene of the right foot has remained stable with clearcut demarcation of the right first, second and third toes.  He also has some heel ulceration that I am hoping to nurse through.  He denies any rest pain or pain in the foot.  He has no evidence of fevers, chills, rigors or shakes in the interim.  He has since been discharged to home and has been walking with a walking shoe.  His left lower extremity aneurysm is yet to be treated and he has not developed any symptoms with regards to the left lower extremity.  He has been taking his Coumadin regularly and has had therapeutic INRs as he reports.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On exam today he is doing quite well.  He is in good spirits and appears much better than in the hospital.  His head and neck exams were unremarkable.  His lungs were clear.  Heart was regular.  His proximal groin and leg incisions have healed up nicely, however there is some dry eschar on the midportion of the wound.  With regards to the toes he has clearcut demarcation and heel ulceration.  There is no evidence of cellulitis, induration or infection of the right lower extremity.  He continues to have a stable looking foot on the left.  Given his extensive peripheral vascular disease I performed PVRs in the office today, which revealed that he has pulsatile PVRs at the right calf and ankle.  He also has slight pulsatile PVRs at the right transmetatarsal level.  This bodes well with regards to his revascularization as well as his potential to either heal or remain stable with regards to the necrosis on the right foot.  His left calf, ankle and transmetatarsal PVRs were similar.  \n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this is an unfortunate gentleman who developed atheroembolic phenomena resulting in digital ischemia as well as heel ischemia with the potential for limb loss in the near future of the right lower extremity.  He does have an untreated aneurysm on the left with potential for atheroembolization of the left lower extremity.  Given this concern, I will proceed next with a left lower extremity revascularization to exclude the popliteal aneurysm so that he does not develop limb-threatening gangrene of the left.  With regards to the right I will try to initiate some hyperbaric oxygen therapy and will probably re-evaluate his distal circulation with an angiogram at the time of his next admission or some time thereafter.  I am hoping to facilitate healing of the heel wound with the final outcome of a transmetatarsal amputation of the right lower extremity but will see how it goes.  My thanks again for this referral.  I apologize for not sending you correspondence earlier.  With this correspondence I will send you his operative diagram as well as his most recent discharge summary.\n",

      "Mr. Single is a 58 year old gentleman with a long standing smoking history who was diagnosed with an extensive stage small cell lung carcinoma involving his liver and his lungs in April 2000 .\n",
      "He was treated with Carboplatin and Etoposide for six cycles and achieved a near complete response .\n",
      "Re-staging scans in September 2000 demonstrated complete resolution of his lung and mediastinal disease and a 90% reduction in his liver metastases .\n",
      "His severe abdominal pain had markedly improved and he was asymptomatic while taking narcotics for analgesia .\n",
      "He presented to the emergency department of Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital on the day of admission with a three day history of severe abdominal pain .\n",
      "He did not have nausea and vomiting , constipation or diarrhea .\n",
      "He had run out of his narcotics for approximately three days .\n",
      "Abdominal computerized tomography scan demonstrated extensive hepatic metastases consistent with relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma .\n",
      "His mental status quickly deteriorated after beginning on his standard doses of Fentanyl patch and a head computerized tomography scan was obtained .\n",
      "This demonstrated multiple enhancing masses in all lobes of the brain .\n",
      "There was no hemorrhage seen .\n",
      "He was started on steroids and began radiation therapy .\n",
      "His abdominal pain was easily controlled with narcotics and his neurological deficits persisted although they did improve somewhat , once starting steroids .\n",
      "Of note , he has an ataxic gait , he has periodic lapses in concentration , and he has dysphonia but no evidence of frank aspiration while he is eating his meals .\n",
      "Initially , he had an expressive aphasia , but this seems to have resolved somewhat .\n",
      "Other staging scans , including bone scan and chest computerized tomography scan were unremarkable for metastases in his bone but there are three new right lower lobe pulmonary nodules .\n",
      "After discussion of findings of relapse of his small cell lung carcinoma with the patient he agreed to do not resuscitate / do not intubate status .\n",
      "Our treatment plan of steroids and radiation therapy is to palliate his symptoms and try to improve his baseline .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "This patient is a 77 year old female who has had a Hancock mitral valve replacement on 10/28/76 by Dr. Melvean Ace .\n",
      "She had a bypass graft with marginal artery at that time , with a flow of 85 cc. 's .\n",
      "She subsequently had done well , although she had had chronic obstructive lung disease .\n",
      "She had been converted to normal sinus rhythm in 1977 , but in 1988 , the mitral valve on an echocardiogram was O.K.\n",
      "Her ejection fraction was 81% , with no mitral regurgitation seen , with a peak gradient of 9 and a mean gradient of about 3 .\n",
      "In 1988 , she developed chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma , and has been followed by Dr. Times , as well as the pulmonologist down where she lives .\n",
      "She had been in and out of atrial flutter and fibrillation most of the time for the last few years .\n",
      "She , on one occasion , had sinus rhythm very briefly .\n",
      "Dr. Avejoh Wierst at the Pedines Community Hospital found her to be in congestive heart failure on two occasions over the last six weeks or so .\n",
      "A TEE showed minimal mitral regurgitation and good left ventricular function .\n",
      "Nevertheless , because of recurrent failure , it was felt that she should be transferred up to the Bri Health for further evaluation .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "On examination here , I could hear no mitral regurgitation murmur .\n",
      "The observation in the hospital showed that she had recurrent runs of rapid atrial fibrillation as well as rapid supraventricular tachycardia going around 130 .\n",
      "This was on diltiazem and digoxin .\n",
      "At the same time , she had two 0.4 second pauses intermittently .\n",
      "Because of this , the diltiazem was stopped , and she was further observed .\n",
      "We could not catheterize her right away because her prothrombin time was a little too high .\n",
      "Over the weekend of observation , she continued to be in supraventricular tachycardia , but also developed a 4.4 second pause on digoxin alone , which was in low therapeutic range .\n",
      "She also had supraventricular tachycardia which was going up to 160 .\n",
      "Therefore , a temporary pacemaker that put in on 5/4 , and diltiazem was restarted .\n",
      "A cardiac catheterization was carried out on 5/5 , once her prothrombin time had fully normalized .\n",
      "It showed that she had a large big right dominant coronary artery , which was free of any significant disease .\n",
      "The graft to the marginal artery was open , with good runoff into a large vessel .\n",
      "The left anterior descending had perhaps a mid-40% lesion only , with good left ventricular contraction and no mitral regurgitation seen on left ventricular angiogram .\n",
      "There was a very modest to moderate mitral valve gradient .\n",
      "The mitral valve area was calculated at 1.2 square centimeters , and then with modest exercise , the mitral valve area calculated to 1.7 square centimeters .\n",
      "Thus , she had , at the most , modest mitral stenosis of no clinical significance .\n",
      "With this data in hand , it appeared that her previous congestive episodes was probably related to sustained periods of rapid heart action with minimal mitral stenosis .\n",
      "A permanent pacemaker was put in on 5/6/92 .\n",
      "This was an Intermedex 292-03 pacemaker , set in the VVI mode with an escape rate of 65 .\n",
      "She tolerated the procedure well .\n",
      "On diltiazem , 60 , q.i.d. , she continued to have supraventricular tachycardia , running at around 130 , so we switched her over to verapamil , four times a day , along with digoxin , 0.125 , alternating with 0.25 , qD , which gave her a blood level of 1.0 .\n",
      "On this program , she is now beginning to ambulate with a heart rate of around 79-80 , and is starting to feel a lot better .\n",
      "We will ambulate her over the next couple of days .\n",
      "We have stopped her Lasix , and we will be watching her daily weight , and that has been quite stable .\n",
      "If she remains stable over the next couple of days , she will be discharged on this program , to be followed jointly by Dr. Avejoh Wierst and Dr. Em Neighburce .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient 's presentation was a very confusing and complicated one with differential diagnosis including a neurodegenerative process such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , a dementia such as Alzheimer 's of a more rapidly progressing nature , and other infectious etiologies such as urinary tract infection or another fever source .\n",
      "Work up included from a neurologic perspective brain MRI , brain EEG , lumbar puncture .\n",
      "In concert with the Neurology Service , who followed the patient with us , we ordered an EEG and MRI with susceptibilities and DWI .\n",
      "An lumbar puncture was performed , in which we measured the opening pressure as unremarkable at 14.5 cm .\n",
      "In addition , per Neurology recommendations , we sent cerebrospinal fluid for Gram stain , bacterial culture , fungal cultures , acid-fast bacilli , __________ antigen , 14-3-3 protein for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , cytology , and , in addition , ordered EEGs , MRIs , antithyroglobulin antibody , antithyroid peroxidase antibody , TSH , ammonia , methyl malonic acid , and , in addition , considered neoplastic tests from the serum and the cerebrospinal fluid including anti-Ma , anti-Ta , anti-CV2 , anti-Hu , anti-yo antibodies .\n",
      "In addition , from a renal perspective , the patient was placed on a Tuesday , Thursday , Saturday dialysis schedule .\n",
      "For her hypertension , shewas given lisinopril .\n",
      "For her FEN , the patient was able to take PO 's and , per Speech and Swallow consult , was permitted to take PO 's with one to one supervision .\n",
      "For prophylaxis , the patient was on subcutaneous heparin and Nexium .\n",
      "From an infectious disease perspective , the patient remained afebrile and , despite a transient bump in her white blood cell count over the weekend of 08/10 through 08/12/2002 , has had a white blood cell count come back to normal range of 12.0 .\n",
      "No obvious source of infection was found , with negative cultures from blood , urine , sputum , the peritoneal fluid , and cerebrospinal fluid .\n",
      "Excellent suggestions from Dr. Pa of the Renal Service included repeating anticardiolipin and lupus anticoagulant , given the patient 's weakly positive lupus anticoagulant in the past and the fact that this could be associated with severe and rapid cognitive decline that was observed in this patient .\n",
      "However , these antibodies were both within normal limits .\n",
      "The patient 's mental status gradually began to improve during the course ofthe weekend from 08/10 through 08/12 and was markedly improved on 08/13/2002 , compared with the day of admission .\n",
      "However , the patient remains not oriented to time or to place , although she is now able to answer questions and actually carry on simple conversations appropriately .\n",
      "The nature of her cognitive decline and change in mental status is still unclear , with most typical and less typical causes of reversible change in mental status having been ruled out and no obvious sources of infection from blood , CSF , sputum , urine , or peritoneal fluid .\n",
      "On the abdominal CT scan , there was a question of an ovarian cystic mass that raised the possibility of ovarian cancer .\n",
      "CA-125 levels were within normal limits .\n",
      "We entertained the possibility of doing a pelvic ultrasound to further characterize this lesion .\n",
      "We will discuss the case further with the Neurology Service , who will evaluate the case more carefully tomorrow with their attending .\n",
      "Pending no further suggestions on their part , we have completed the metabolic work up for reversible causes of dementia and will likely discharge the patient to return to the Termarimed pending no further suggestions from Neurology or other consultants .\n",

      "The patient has received physical therapy and occupational therapy and her recovery is near complete .\n",
      "During evaluation of her neurologic status , it was determined that for several months prior to admission , the patient has been too unsteady to ambulate .\n",
      "On our exam she is found to have a significant amount of ataxia , especially in the midline and the exact cause of this is unknown .\n",
      "There are multiple possible contributions and this is where her need for careful internal medical evaluation has arisen .\n",
      "At the time we were to embark on this evaluation , the patient 's family strongly requested that she be transferred to the Sas General Hospital .\n",
      "What follows is a summary of her medical problems and their possible relationship to her ataxia .\n",
      "Her ataxia is likely due to some cerebellar function , though this is not certain .\n",
      "Moreover her MRI did not show any discrete cerebellar lesions .\n",
      "Our leading theory at this point is that her cerebellar dysfunction relates to perineoplastic syndrome , relating to her history of breast Ca .\n",
      "As I mentioned above , her evaluation was limited by her cardiologic status at the time .\n",
      "While mammogram and CA-15.3 and breast exam are all normal , the idea of a perineoplastic syndrome with or without concomitant breast Ca has reared its head .\n",
      "Two possible markers are anti-Hu syndrome and anti-Yo antibody .\n",

      "EKG , when the patient goes out of left bundle branch block transiently shows an anterolateral Q/wave inversion .\n",
      "We would like to discontinue her Isordil to improve upon some orthostatic hypotension , but we are not certain whether her heart will tolerate this .\n",
      "Persantine thallium is scheduled at this time , but is yet to be performed .\n",
      "The patient has a history of orthostatic hypotension x many years .\n",
      "It has been evaluated in the past without success .\n",
      "During her hospitalization , we confirmed the presence of this , even when she was hydrated with saline , to a fractional excretion of sodium of 2% .\n",
      "Studies of her autonomic system did not document any dysautonomia .\n",
      "Studies of skin galvanic conduction were normal and her RR interval evaluation was not abnormal .\n",
      "This is a chronic problem but may be contributing to her current weakness and inability to walk .\n",
      "Florinef is to be considered , however stopping the Isordil is one goal .\n",
      "The patient has a history of bronchiectasis from a childhood pneumonia .\n",
      "In addition there is a distant history of M. kansasaii infection .\n",
      "This has been evaluated by Dr. Screen at Sas General Hospital and probably relates to her lung xray .\n",

      "It is doubtful that she has chronic PE , but this is one consideration .\n",
      "It is likely that she has pulmonary hypertension from her lung disease , and so this is a consideration .\n",
      "The patient had mild hyponatremia during this hospitalization with a sodium as low as 131 .\n",
      "We think this is likely due to an SIADH as she is euvolemic .\n",
      "This can be evaluated further and is not a problem at this time .\n",
      "The patient has glaucoma .\n",
      "Her medications are as listed below .\n",

      "Finally , he fell in his bath tub and was unable to get up .\n",

      "there was no evidence of serious trauma .\n",
      "His general examination revealed a blood pressure of 145/80 ; pulse of 72 and regular .\n",
      "He was in no acute distress .\n",
      "His neck was supple .\n",
      "The chest was normal .\n",
      "The cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs noted .\n",

      "There were also a few myoclonic jerks .\n",
      "He also had some frontal lobe signs .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",

      "The lumbar spine films showed an old L-9 compression fracture which was confirmed on cat scanning .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "The patient was evaluated by Dr. Doll Grendbly from the Neurology Service who thought that there was a good possibility that he had Parkinson 's Disease with certainly some Parkinsonian features to his picture .\n",
      "However , some of his features could be explained by normal pressure hydrocephalus although the normal head scan seemed to exclude that .\n",
      "There was also a question of Alzheimer 's Disease to explain his dementia .\n",
      "Dr. Block recommended a trial of Sinemet therapy which was begun in the hospital and he was then transferred to are habilitation hospital for vigorous physical therapy and further evaluation of his Sinemet trial .\n",
      "He will be followed closely in the out-patient department by both Dr. Block and his primary care physician , Dr. Curling .\n",

      "Mr. Mass was placed on multiple courses of antibiotics .\n",
      "Most recently , he was on a 28 day course of Vancomycin , ofloxacin , and Flagyl , for blood cultures that were positive for gram positive cocci and enteric and non-enteric gram negative rods .\n",
      "This 28 day course was completed on 07/15/95 .\n",

      "He remained total parenteral nutrition-dependent throughout his hospital course .\n",
      "By the end of June , it became clear that Mr. Mass would require aggressive surgical intervention in order to eradicate his intra-abdominal bursts of intermittent sepsis ; however , long discussions with the patient and his wife , who was his health-care proxy , revealed that they felt that no further aggressive intervention be attempted .\n",
      "The patient had been made a do not resuscitate do not intubate patient earlier in his hospital stay .\n",
      "Multiple discussions were held between Dr. Mass , the rest of the surgical team , and the patient 's wife , with this same result .\n",
      "After discussion with the patient 's primary doctor , Dr. Douet at Vassdiysey Medical Center , it was felt that the patient and his family would be best served if the patient were transferred to Vassdiysey Medical Center .\n",

His nocturia has decreased from three to one.  His hands feel a little \"fuzzy.\"  The trembles, which he has had for some time are possibly better or the same, still a little worse on the left hand than the right.  \n",
      " \n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On physical examination he looks well.  His weight is up to 230 pounds.  He has no percussible bony tenderness throughout.  His abdomen is entirely negative, so is his incision.  \n",
      " \n",
      "IMPRESSION:  Clinically possibly slightly improved, certainly no evidence of progression.  \n",
      " \n",
      "PLAN:  I will obtain a repeat chest and thoracic spine CT, as well as a bone scan.  Assuming that these are not indicative of further progression, I plan to see him in routine follow up in four to six months.  Dr. Levine would like some blood tests drawn on him, which I will happy to arrange when I hear exactly what they are.  Dr. Sweet is still seeing him frequently and giving him Norvasc and Atenolol for his blood pressure.  \n",

      "She was in sinus tachycardia here with right bundle branch block and continued ST segment elevation with Qs in 3 and AVF .\n",
      "She was admitted to the Coronary Care Unit where she continued to have intermittent marked bradycardia with junctional rhythm and relatively low blood pressures and runs of flow ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "She became increasingly disoriented .\n",
      "She developed first degree AV block and then Wenckebach block .\n",
      "The chest films showed mild cephalization .\n",

      "She had TIMI 2 to 3 flow in the right coronary artery after stenting and removal of clot from the right coronary artery .\n",
      "She continued to have intermittent runs of ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "She remained intubated but her hemodynamics improved somewhat .\n",
      "Dobutamine was diminished because of the wide complex tachycardia and she developed atrial fibrillation .\n",

      "The right ventricular function was normal .\n",
      "After extubation she developed a considerable amount of upper respiratory stridor which was treated initially with Decadron .\n",
      "The patient was seen in consultation by ENT consultants who found that she had some hardened inspissated secretions in the region of the vocal cords , glottic inlet and subglottis .\n",
      "There was no structural abnormality .\n",
      "Moistened oxygen and Mucomyst was given with eventual restoration of her voice and diminution in her stridor .\n",

      "Renal and bladder ultrasounds were normal .\n",
      "She had abnormal urinary cytology however and Dr. Jescdrig strongly recommended that this be followed up by cystoscopy when she is able to do that .\n",
      "That can take place either here at his office or in Aersing Rocuch Sun or when she returns to Carfachemoses Hospital .\n",
      "Because of alternating and fluctuating mental status , she had a head CT scan which showed small area of intracranial bleeding .\n",
      "This was followed up and was shown to resolve .\n",
      "MR angiogram revealed no evidence of renal artery stenosis .\n",
      "A MRI of the head because of the small area of bleeding was done to look for amyloid angiopathy which would have made anticoagulation dangerous .\n",

      "Mayta Neek is a 69-year-old patient of Dr. Queszucenove Tadl at Cochusetts Medical Center .\n",
      "He presents with increasing chest pain and shortness of breath .\n",
      "He has a long history of coronary artery disease and has a two prior coronary bypass surgeries .\n",
      "His first coronary bypass surgery was on 5/7/1985 by Dr. Riez .\n",
      "He had LIMA to the LAD and vein graft to the diagonal and then a snake fashion two circumflexes and to the acute marginal branch of the right coronary artery .\n",
      "He presented with angina and had an occluded LAD and severe circumflex and right coronary disease .\n",
      "He had normal left ventricular function .\n",
      "He did well , but had recurrent angina by 1999 and cardiac catheterization in March of 2000 showed normal left ventricular function with a native nondominant right coronary artery having a 95% stenosis and the vein graft to this vessel was occluded .\n",
      "The left main was normal .\n",
      "The LAD was also occluded .\n",
      "The circumflex was patent , although there was disease of the obtuse marginal branches .\n",
      "The LIMA to the LAD was patent , but there was downstream 70% lesions at the apical portion of the LAD .\n",
      "The snake graft was open to the diagonal and to the first obtuse marginal branch , but was occluded to the second portion of this vessel .\n",
      "For this reason , he had a second bypass operation on 5/5/2000 by Dr. Riez .\n",
      "He had a vein graft to the acute marginal of the right coronary artery in snake fashion to the terminal portion of the right coronary artery .\n",
      "He had a vein graft to the diagonal and obtuse marginal one and a vein graft on the LAD bypassing the mid lesion .\n",
      "The LIMA was left from the first surgery .\n",
      "He did have transient atrial fibrillation after surgery .\n",
      "He had chest pain and an abnormal stress test in 2001 and cardiac catheterization at that time on 8/28/2001 showed that all the grafts were patent , but the runoff to the first diagonal for the vein graft was compromised and he had a 2.5 x 15 mm S660 stent placed at the ostium of the diagonal branch .\n",
      "He did have recurrent episodes of pain and his last stress test on 1/17/2005 showed that he could exercise for 9 minutes and then reached a peak heart rate of 99 on medication and a blood pressure of 150/100 , but he had shortness of breath and a posterolateral defect with some filling .\n",
      "He therefore was referred for cardiac catheterization .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "His past medical history includes hypertension , elevated cholesterol , and a herniated disc .\n",
      "He also has had cataract repairs .\n",

      "He does not drink and does not smoke .\n",
      "ALLERGIES :\n",
      "He is allergic to contrast dye having had hypotension and is premedicated with steroids .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "On exam , he is 5 feet , 9 inches , and 160 pounds .\n",
      "His blood pressure is 130/75 .\n",
      "His pulse is 50 and regular .\n",
      "His neck veins are not distended .\n",
      "His head and neck exam is normal .\n",

      "Includes an electrocardiogram shows normal sinus rhythm with right bundle-branch block .\n",
      "Hematocrit 43% , potassium 4.3 , and creatinine of 1.0 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the cardiac cath laboratory .\n",
      "There , the native right coronary artery was occluded and the vein graft to the RV marginal and the right-sided PDA was patent .\n",
      "The LAD was occluded and the LIMA to the proximal LAD was patent , but there was also a jump graft that went from the mid to the distal segment of the LAD and that was also patent .\n",
      "The vein graft to the diagonal and circumflex was also patent and the ostial diagonal stent was also patent .\n",
      "The culprit territory was the distal left-sided PDA coming off the circumflex and this had an 85% stenosis .\n",
      "This was a very small vessel and this was a tortuous segment and a long lesion .\n",
      "It was felt that this single lesion given the open distal right territory was not worth stenting and it was felt that he should be managed medically .\n",
      "Left ventriculography showed inferior hypokinesis and anterolateral hypokinesis with preserved left ventricular function .\n",
      "He tolerated the procedure well .\n",
      "He was monitored for the day .\n",
      "He ambulated without difficulty .\n",
      "He was discharged home and will be followed closely by his physicians at Sko Gerb Timp Valley Health and at Middso Memorial Hospital 's .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Procedures :\n",
      "The patient was evaluated initially by the Otolaryngology Service with the consideration that his right-sided sinus disease was contributing to his sixth nerve palsy .\n",

      "However , further review by Neurology Consult Service indicated that the sinus disease was likely not sufficient to explain the patient 's cranial nerve findings .\n",
      "The working diagnosis at that point was the Miller-Fisher variant of Guillain-Barre syndrome versus less likely causes .\n",
      "The patient underwent lumbar puncture and also had an electromyelogram performed .\n",
      "EMG findings were in fact consistent with variant Guillain-Barre syndrome .\n",
      "It was then determined that the patient should be started on intravenous immunoglobulin .\n",
      "He was therefore started with a treatment course of 6 days of IV IgA after obtaining an IgA level .\n",
      "The patient tolerated this treatment course well .\n",
      "His cranial neuropathy was monitored carefully and was found to be stable to slightly improving in the first several days of treatment .\n",

      "electrocardiogram showed 2 mm of ST depressions in V4-6 .\n",
      "Head CT scan showed a 2 x 2 x 2 left anterior temporal hemorrhage with minimal surrounding edema .\n",
      "There was also evidence of an old right frontal infarction .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "1) NEUROLOGY :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Neurology Intensive Care Unit for intensive monitoring due to his frail condition .\n",
      "He had an electroencephalogram performed on his initial admittance to the Intensive Care Unit which did not show any evidence of seizure activity .\n",
      "It did , however , show diffuse slowing .\n",
      "He was given 1.5 grams of Dilantin in the emergency room as well as 2 mgs of intravenous Ativan which did little to stop his rhythmic blinking that he showed from time to time on examination .\n",
      "His hypertension ; his high blood pressure was controlled with intravenous nitroglycerine in the early going and then he was switched to an oral regimen for better control after he was removed from the Intensive Care Unit .\n",
      "He continued to do well over the next few days and was quite surprisingly intact on both sides of his body in terms of his ability to move .\n",
      "He did consistently have more movement on the left side of his body than on the right , but he gradually became more awake and alert and communicative and his endotracheal tube was removed on the second day of admission .\n",
      "His diagnosis of progressive supranuclear palsy was placed under question on further examination of his eye movement since he was able to have excellent superior gaze especially with the bells phenomenon which would not be seen with progressive supranuclear palsy .\n",
      "It was felt that his dementing illness and rigidity was most likely due to some type of cortico-basal ganglia degeneration process , but this was not clarified during this admission .\n",
      "It was not felt likely to be due to Parkinson 's disease , as he had no significant response to Eldopa in the past and the patient had no evidence of tremor , although he was quite rigid and bradykinetic .\n",
      "He had an magnetic resonance imaging performed on October 18 , 1996 .\n",
      "This showed the unchanged left temporal parenchymal interparenchymal hematoma and the old embolic right frontal infarct , but there were no new lesions and no evidence of his susceptibility studies to suggest old bleeds which might have been consistent with amylase angiopathy .\n",
      "In addition , he gadolinium scan did not show enhancement at the area of his hemorrhage , so tumor was felt to be unlikely .\n",
      "However , this issue will need to be re-evaluated in six months time once the hematoma is less prominent to see if there is possibly an underlying tumor or arterial venous malformation that could be currently compressed by the area of hemorrhage .\n",
      "The etiology of his bleed was felt to be most likely secondary to hypertension , but these other causes could also not be ruled out .\n",
      "2) CARDIOVASCULAR :\n",
      "His electrocardiogram was concerning for ischemia .\n",
      "He was on intravenous TNG and was supratherapeutic on his anti-coagulation .\n",
      "He did have a slight elevation of his TPK with an additional value of 198 with a MB fraction of 5.7 , which makes for a percentage of 2.9 .\n",
      "That was at the highest percentage that he had and after this his percentage came down to 1.6 , 1.0 on subsequent CKMBs and was felt that he had a very small \" leaflet \" .\n",
      "He remained chest pain free throughout his admission .\n",
      "3) PULMONARY :\n",
      "After his initial intubation he remained quite stable .\n",
      "He was found to be at a large aspiration risk given his decreased mental status and the lack of presence of a gag reflex .\n",
      "However , he was given aggressive pulmonary toilets including chest physical therapy and aspiration precautions and the patient did not develop any pulmonary symptoms during his admission .\n",
      "4) HEMATOLOGY :\n",
      "He had his prothrombin time reversed with Vitamin K 2 mgs on admission subcutaneously as well as two units of fresh frozen plasma given in the emergency room .\n",
      "His anticoagulation status had to be monitored very closely due to his history of deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolus as well as atrial fibrillation , but he could not be placed on a high amount of anticoagulation because of the new intraparenchymal bleed .\n",
      "It was decided that his goal INR was to be 2.0 .\n",
      "He did drop below 1.5 at one time , at which time he was placed on heparin intravenous to carry him through that period , but his discharge INR was around 2 and he was off of heparin at that time .\n",
      "It was decided that he would have very close monitoring of his anticoagulation status in the future to prevent further problems .\n",
      "5) GASTROINTESTINAL :\n",
      "He was evaluated by the speech and swallow pathology group at the Ph University Of Medical Center and it was decided that he was able to swallow on his own with a soft solid diet with supervision .\n",
      "Thus , his nasogastric tube was discontinued on October 19 , 1996 and he tolerated feeding quite well .\n",
      "In discussions with the family , given his age and number of medical problems , it was decided that the patient should be do not resuscitate should he have a terminal cardiac event during his admission or during future admissions .\n",
      "However , he was still an intubation candidate if it were felt to be a short term procedure .\n",
      "The family realizes that the long term outlook for this patient is not very good , but they would like to currently continue to provide him with all support necessary , short of resuscitation measures or heroic measures should he have a cardiopulmonary arrest .\n",

      "Mrs. Joshi returns to the office for routine followup.  Since last seen, she apparently was without evidence of increasing BUN and creatinine and for this reason was advised to transiently hold both her lisinopril and Zaroxolyn.  By doing so, her creatinine fell from 2.2 to 1.6 and BUN from 117 to 57.  She subsequently has resumed her lisinopril therapy, as apparently her blood pressure increased off her ACE inhibitor.  In addition, as part of her followup last March, she underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test during which time she achieved a peak heart rate of 65, peak blood pressure of 129/50, stopping because she reached the end of the adenosine infusion protocol.  Her gated SPECT imaging demonstrated a global left ventricular ejection fraction of 38% with a mildly dilated left ventricle and akinesis of the basal inferoseptal and entire inferior wall.  Her rest-stress perfusion imaging showed similarly a large fixed perfusion defect in the inferior and basal inferoseptal wall without any area of reversible ischemia.  Her last echocardiogram performed in July 2071 showed a residual of left ventricular ejection fraction mildly reduced at 45% with severe inferoseptal and inferior hypokinesis.  In addition, at that time showed evidence for trivial mitral and tricuspid regurgitation and her echo was essentially unchanged from her prior study in March 2071.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, she is concerned primarily about her inability to lose weight, and in fact states that during a recent vacation she actually discontinued her diet.  Presently, she continues on a regimen of Toprol-XL 37.5 mg p.o. daily, simvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, lisinopril 5 mg p.o. daily, potassium chloride 20 mEq p.o. b.i.d., furosemide 160 mg p.o. b.i.d., Coumadin, enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg p.o. daily, Niferex 150 mg p.o. daily, Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.a.m. and Humulin N 20 units subcutaneous q.p.m.\n",

      "Physical exam reveals a pleasant, mildly overweight woman in no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 120/52, heart rate 45 and irregularly regular, respirations 14 and unlabored, and weight 253 pounds, which is 12 pounds above her weight of six months ago.  The neck is supple.  JVP is flat.  Carotids are without significant bruits.  Chest remains clear.  Cardiac exam shows normal S1, physiologically split S2 with a soft systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to the base.  No significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is overweight, but otherwise benign without evidence of abdominal aneurysm or bruit.  Extremities reveal trace bipedal edema.  Peripheral pulses are detectable, albeit mildly diminished.\n",

      "Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation flutter with at times of significant AV block with pauses as high as approximately 2 seconds.  There is evidence of a prior inferior myocardial infarction and minor nonspecific ST and T-wave changes.  Compared with her last electrocardiogram, her heart rate at times is slower.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression:  Ms. Joshi remains stable from a cardiovascular perspective, however, I am obviously concerned about her potential for lightheadedness in light of her bradycardia.  I have asked her to decrease her Toprol-XL to 25 mg p.o. daily and to repeat an EKG four to five days after doing so.  I of course have reminded her as to the importance of getting in contact with you or myself straight away should she develop any symptoms suggestive of lightheadedness or dizziness.  She understands that she may require a permanent pacemaker in the future.  Most recent blood studies show a significantly elevated glucose of 183 (she states she is trying to tailor her insulin regimen with you) and in January, normal liver function studies except for an alkaline phosphatase of 304 and lipid profile last September notable for a cholesterol of 134, triglyceride of 74, HDL 58, and LDL 61.  She understands the importance of continuing to adhere to a low-saturated fat, low-cholesterol diet while remaining on her antilipemic therapy.  She will discuss with you and her nephrologist the optimal management of her mild renal insufficiency.  In light of both her diabetes and coronary disease, it certainly would be optimal if possible to continue her on her ACE inhibitor.  At the present time, she does not meet criteria for prophylactic placement of an AICD and her New York Heart Association class I to II status precludes the need for consideration of biventricular pacing.  Other than reducing her beta-blocker regimen as described above, I have not further altered her current medical program.\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Neil comes in today to follow up on multiple medical issues, the first of which is his benign prostatic hypertrophy.  He states that since beginning the Flomax that we started him on in January, his symptoms are at least 50% better.  He is only getting up once per night to go to the bathroom and is not having any hesitancy or difficulty passing his urine.  He is also following up on his elevated cholesterol, his hypertension.  He states that he has been trying to follow a better diet, but does state that he has not been particularly good about getting regular exercise.  He is also following up on his diabetes.  He is not having any difficulty with his medications.  He did not schedule his colonoscopy that I had referred him for in January but states that he would be willing to do so after the spring.  He is also following up on his COPD.  He states that he has been using the Pulmicort and the Spiriva as well as the Serevent Diskus on a daily basis.  He states that his breathing has been good.  He is hardly wheezing at all and he has better exercise tolerance than before.  He is also noted to have hepatitis C as well as fatty liver.  A recent ultrasound also demonstrated gallstones.  He does not have any postprandial symptoms of right upper quadrant pain, nausea or vomiting.  He does question whether or not he is a candidate for treatment of hepatitis C.\n",
      "\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for B-cell lymphoma, pontine stroke, basilar artery stent, herpes zoster, graft versus host disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, Pseudomonas pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, heart murmur, BPH and hepatitis C as well as gallstones and fatty liver.\n",
      "\n",
      "MEDICATIONS:  Serevent Diskus, metformin, folate, Flomax, Spiriva, albuterol, Lopressor, Combivent, Pulmicort, vitamin B12, vitamin B6, magnesium and aspirin.\n",
      "\n",
      "ALLERGIES:  He has an allergy to ACE inhibitors, dapsone, ganciclovir, sulfa, and Bactrim.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 140/90, on repeat 148/90, pulse is 64, temperature 97.1 and weight is 259 pounds.  In general, he is in no acute distress.  The HEENT exam demonstrates no icterus and no injection.  The oropharynx is clear.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with no wheezes and no rales.  Heart is regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs, rubs or gallops.  The abdomen is soft, nondistended, and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  The extremities show no edema.\n",
      "\n",
      "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n",
      "1.  Diabetes, his most recent hemoglobin A1c was 6.5 and this does not need to be done again until July.  He was advised again to continue to follow a healthy diet and offered again referral to a nutritionist, currently declines at this time.  He is up-to-date with his Ophthalmology exam.\n",
      "2.  BPH.  We will increase his Flomax to 0.8 mg to see if we can further improve his symptoms.  Fortunately they are responding quite well to this.\n",
      "3.  Hypertension.  This is not adequate control with his current regimen, however, we are increasing his Flomax today so I would like to see how he does in terms of his blood pressure when I see him back in a month.  If his blood pressure is still elevated, we will then modify his antihypertensive regimen to improve this.\n",
      "4.  COPD.  Currently, he is doing well with his current regimen.  He has no evidence of a flare at this time and he is advised to continue getting as much exercise as possible.\n",
      "5.  Elevated cholesterol.  His LDL goal should be less than 100 if not less than 70 given his multiple medical issues.  If his LDL is greater than 70 on this most recent check we may try him on a small dose of simvastatin to see if we can get him under goal without an elevation in his liver function tests.\n",
      "6.  Abnormal liver function tests.  These are a combination of his hepatitis C and the fatty liver.  It is reasonable to have him seen in Hepatology to see if he would be a candidate for treatment of the hepatitis C.  For now, we will work on his diabetes, weight loss and management of his cholesterol and we will refer him to Hepatology.  Follow up with me is in one month.\n",

      "\n",
      "  I was happy to see Michelle Klein (2474410: DOB August 6, 2075) who comes along with her husband, Nathaniel, for follow up cardiac evaluation. Michelle has been stable from a cardiac point of view. She has coronary artery disease and underwent LAD stent placement in 2148. She had negative stress sestamibi study in November 2151. She has been free of angina or cardiac-related symptoms. She notes occasional orthostatic dizziness. Her prior stamina symptoms have improved greatly. She has well-controlled hypertension on stable medical regimen. Her recent diagnosis of myelofibrosis has been followed through closely by her hematology group here at Valley County and we have discussed this at length. Michelle feels far better than at her last several visits and I am very happy to see this.\n",
      "\n",
      "On clinical exam, blood pressure right arm is 130/80 mmHg, pulses are equal, normal and all well felt. First heart sound is normal to soft. Second is normal. There is a 1+/6 systolic apical murmur. No diastolic murmurs are present. No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. Thyroid is postoperative and stable. Neck veins are flat. Carotid upstrokes are normal. Lungs are clear. Abdominal exam is normal. I do not feel enlargement of the abdominal aorta.\n",
      "\n",
      "The electrocardiogram is unchanged. It continues to show minimal nonspecific ST flattening and left atrial prominence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Medications: Michelle no longer takes the verapamil, atenolol 50 mg per day, Lipitor 10 mg per day, Diovan 40 mg daily, Protonix 40 mg b.i.d., Synthroid 1.12 mg per day, vitamin B12 500 mg, B6 100 mg, magnesium 400 mg per day, and D3 2000 IU per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "If there are any questions at anytime, please call me. I am happy to see Michelle 's spirits are good and that she is feeling better and actually, her clinical exam seems excellent as well. She does not manifest tachycardia. I note that her hematocrit is 31%.  Visit duration 40 min.-half in discussion re he cardiac and hematologic issues.\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient presents today for annual physical.  The patient states he has become enlightened recently that when he goes to Tim Horton's, they pretreated his coffee with sugar as a role and he thinks that is the reason for his diabetic, lack of control over the years.  He has been eliminating concentrated sweets in his diet.  After a while, his blood sugars have gotten much better by his report.  He recently had an eye examination showing stable background retinopathy without any recent changes.  He has had no active podiatry issues over the past 2 months has had no recent chest pain, shortness of breath or PND.  He sees Dr. Isaac Ulibarri for a cardiomyopathy standpoint.  With his AICD everything seems to be working fine according to him when they interrogate his device.  He reports no fever, shakes, chills, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.  Again, he has had no recent chest pain, PND, or orthopnea.  He has had no dysphagia, odynophagia, melena, hematemesis, hematochezia, dysuria, hematuria or polyuria.\n",

      "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Annual physical, preventative maintenance.  The patient had a colonoscopy in 2125 and was told to come back in 2130 because of benign polyps.  I did recommend guaiac stool cards today for home testing purposes.  Immunizations are up-to-date.  He did receive an H1N1 and a seasonal flu vaccine through his employer and for private pharmacies.  His Pneumovax is due to be a booster in 2 years' time.  We are recommending a PSA and a DRE annually starting today.  Labs were also drawn in the office for CBC, CMP, and lipid profile.  The patient is declining Zostavax at this time.  We will recommend a followup in 1 year for an annual physical.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Poorly controlled type 2 diabetes.  The patient has now eliminated concentrated sweets from his diet, although I do suspect dietary noncompliance beyond table sugar.  Recommend checking a hemoglobin A1c today, urine for microalbumin, lipid panel and creatinine as well as a BUN and a GFR.  I would recommend continuing his insulin NPH 42 units daily, but we may need to recommend an endocrine consult if his A1c remains elevated despite dietary improvement.  We did recommend aggressive weight loss and exercise as this is a major impediment to his glucose control.  I would recommend follow up in 3 to 4 months.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Obesity.  We will check a TSH, lipid panel and glucose to ensure that he is in good metabolic balance.  I do suspect continued poorly controlled diabetes given his past history.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  CAD with history of DVT.  He has had an ICD interrogated recently.  We will check a lipid panel today.  We would like to strive for an LDL less than 70 given his high risk status, I would recommend changing his steroid to a higher dose if required at that point.\n",

      "Because his need for multiple transfusionsm he was transfused with radiated Leuco four units .\n",
      "The patient had a good bump in his hematocrit , more than expected from 22 to high 20 's range next day after 3 1/2 units , but later that evening had a drop in his hematocrit so was given 4 more 1/2 units at this point for a total of 4 units packed red blood cells .\n",
      "He again did not bump his hematocrit sufficiently and remained in the high 20 's after a total of 4 units , so he was given 2 more total units in 1/2 units segments the following day .\n",
      "His hematocrit subsequently bumped to greater than 30 and was discharged with hematocrit of 32 on 11-7-93 .\n",
      "The patient remained asymptomatic from a CHF stand point and felt much better after the transfusions .\n",

      "The patient was seen on 5-29-92 by the ward cardiology consult .\n",
      "His assessment was that this was a 76 year old gentleman with atrial fibrillation and a dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy status post two embolic / thrombotic phenomena with a recent history of an upper gastrointestinal bleed .\n",
      "He recommended that the patient be heparinized as the Scabeth T Hospital Surgery Team had already done and that Coumadinization be begun within a few days of heparinization .\n",

      "On 5-30-92 the patient 's gastroenterologist Dr. Ri Blood was contacted .\n",
      "Dr. Blood was on vacation , however Dr. Kotethorereke , his partner was in the office and went through Mr. Flytheleungfyfe 's old chart and noted that Dr. Blood had performed esophagogastroduodenoscopy on the patient during his North Carolina admission for an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed .\n",
      "During this time in January of 1992 Dr. Blood had noted two distal esophageal ulcers .\n",
      "He had treated both of these with epinephrine injection .\n",
      "Follow up endoscopy on Mar 15 , 1992 had shown two deformities in the distal esophagus corresponding to the presence of esophageal ulcers treated earlier in January .\n",

      "We discussed Coumadinization with Dr. Blood and noting Dr. Blood 's earlier findings we , in conjunction with Dr. Blood decided to Coumadinize the patient and Coumadinization was begun on 5-30-92 .\n",
      "It was noted at that time that a stable dose for the patient earlier when he had been Coumadinized before was 5 mg. po q.day .\n",
      "That was concurrent with Albuterol 150 mg. po q.day .\n",
      "Given the patient 's history of ulcer and hiatus hernia and the fact that we did wish to anticoagulate the patient we actually performed upper endoscopy on the patient on 5-31-92 .\n",
      "The findings were as follows .\n",
      "The principal operating surgeon was Dr. Ca Scgach with the assistance of Dr. Jesclinke .\n",

      "In the stomach there were mild erosions of the gastroesophageal junction without other abnormalities .\n",
      "There were no abnormalities into the second portion of the duodenum .\n",
      "The overall impression was that there was an apparent healed esophageal ulcer , a hiatus hernia , an esophageal mucosal changes distally were consistent with a Barrett 's esophagus .\n",
      "No biopsy was taken .\n",
      "The biopsy was deferred because the patient had received a dose of Coumadin the night before and had a prothrombin time of approximately 15 before the procedure .\n",
      "On 6-1-92 the patient went to the echocardiography suite .\n",
      "Findings were :\n",
      "there was no evidence of intracardiac thrombus , although this was a transcardiac echocardiogram which is not the best technique for visualizing intraatrial thrombus .\n",
      "There was a thickened mitral leaflet with mild mitral regurgitation .\n",
      "There was focal calcification in the mitral annulus .\n",
      "The aortic leaflets were thickened with no aortic stenosis .\n",
      "There was trace aortic insufficiency .\n",
      "The aorta at the sinuses was ectactic at 42 millimeters .\n",
      "The left ventricular size and function were within normal limits with a left ventricular ejection fractio n of 57 percent .\n",
      "There was trace tricuspid insufficiency .\n",
      "There was evidence of an old pacer wire in the right atrium .\n",
      "There was trace pulmonary insufficiency with right ventricular systolic blood pressure of 35 millimeters .\n",
      "There was paradoxical septal motion consistent with bundle branch block .\n",
      "The patient , it should be noted at this time , was doing very well and he was taking regular diet , voiding spontaneously .\n",
      "He had been therapeutically heparinized since going to the operating room and by 6-2-92 his prothrombin time was beginning to elevate .\n",
      "On 6-2-92 he presented a new complaint with left wrist swelling and pain .\n",
      "He confessed to a history of gout in the past and consequently Rheumatology consult was obtained .\n",
      "The Rheumatologist entertained gout as an attractive diagnosis given his history and they aspirated the joint .\n",
      "Joint aspirate was remarkable for calcium phosphate crystals , that is the patient actually had a case of pseudo-gout .\n",
      "Joint aspirate that was sent for culture has been negative to date and today is 6-4-92 .\n",
      "The rheumatologist recommended checking a wrist xray to rule out calcification .\n",
      "A wrist xray was obtained of the left wrist and it did show chondrocalcinosis thus confirming the diagnosis of pseudo-gout .\n",
      "The patient 's pseudogout was treated with Colchicine 0.6 mg. po q. 3 hours and he received nine such doses over a time span of about 42 hours with some relief of his symptoms .\n",
      "He is being discharged on Colchicine 0.6 mg. PO t.i.d. as an acute measure for his pseudo-gout and that prescription will last until he sees Dr. Blood in follow up this coming Tuesday .\n",
      "Today , on 6-4-92 , the patient has no new complaint .\n",
      "Yesterday , on 6-3-92 , his prothrombin time was just a bit over 16 , between 16 and 17 and consequently his heparin was discontinued .\n",
      "Today his prothrombin time is 16.7 and it looks like 5 mg. of Coumadin per day is going to be a stable dose for him .\n",
      "Consequently , he is ready for discharge today .\n",
      "The only other thing of note is that secondary to his anticoagulation with Coumadin his Ecotrin has been discontinued .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Patient is a 28 year old gravida IV , para 2 with metastatic cervical cancer admitted with a question of malignant pericardial effusion .\n",
      "Patient underwent a total abdominal hysterectomy in 02/90 for a 4x3.6x2 cm cervical mass felt to be a fibroid at Vanor .\n",
      "Pathology revealed poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix with spots of vaginal margins and metastatic squamous cell carcinoma in the cardinal ligaments with extensive lymphatic invasion .\n",
      "Patient was felt to have stage 2B disease and post-operatively , she was treated with intracavitary and external beam radiation therapy and low dose Cisplatin .\n",
      "On ultrasound in 02/91 , the patient was found to have bilateral cystic adnexal masses confirmed on physical examination .\n",
      "She underwent exploratory laparotomy and had a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\n",
      "Pathology was negative for tumor and showed peritubal and periovarian adhesions .\n",
      "The patient now presents with a three to four week history of shortness of breath and a dry non-productive cough .\n",
      "She was evaluated by Dr. Mielke , a Pulmonologist , who found her to be wheezing and performed pulmonary function tests which showed an FEV1 of 1.1 and an FVC of 1.8 .\n",
      "She was admitted to Weekscook University Medical Center with a diagnosis of possible asthma .\n",
      "Room air arterial blood gas showed a pO2 of 56 , a pCO2 of 35 , and a pH of 7.52 .\n",
      "EKG showed sinus tachycardia at 100 and echo revealed pericardial effusion , a 10 mm pulsus paradoxus was noted , and no evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "Given the patient 's history of cervical cancer , the pericardial effusion was felt most likely to be malignant .\n",
      "She was therefore transferred to the Retelk County Medical Center for further care .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "As above .\n",
      "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "02/90 , total abdominal hysterectomy complicated by ureteral transection with right ureteral tube placed for six weeks , stent tube placed in left ureter six weeks prior to admission for a hydronephrosis post , in 03/91 , bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and appendectomy .\n",

      "Electrolytes were within normal limits , liver function tests within normal limits , and EKG showed a heart rate of 128 , axis 73 , and possible ectopic P .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted for a new pericardial effusion which was felt most likely to be secondary to metastatic cervical cancer .\n",
      "There was no evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "An echocardiogram was scheduled and Cardiology was consulted .\n",
      "Echocardiogram showed moderate anterior pericardial effusion of approximately 600 cc with diastolic indications of the right ventricle and low velocity paradox .\n",
      "Cardiology did not feel that tamponade at this time was a concern and that a tap need not be performed .\n",
      "She continued to have pulmonary wheezing , unknown origin , without history of asthma .\n",
      "Her steroids were tapered and Pulmonary was consulted who recommended a CT scan of the chest to evaluate the lung parenchyma , induce sputum for CBC , arterial blood gas , continuing of the beta agonist inhalers , and trial of steroid inhalers .\n",
      "They felt it was most likely a malignant lymphangitic spread with pericardial involvement versus infectious , other cardiovascular causes , or viral bronchiolitis .\n",
      "She had pulmonary function tests repeated which showed an FEV1 of 36% of predicted and FVC of 56% of predicted .\n",
      "Room air arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.45 , pO2 of 63 , a pCO2 of 41 , and fairly significant AA gradient .\n",
      "She was continued on two liters of oxygen awaiting her CT scan on 06/14 and she developed a new junctional rhythm with a question of a new rub versus murmur on examination .\n",
      "Cardiology felt she had a rub and her pulsus was still 10 .\n",
      "EKG showed an ectopic low atrial P and they thought she was still stable without evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "She should have a follow-up echocardiogram .\n",
      "Echocardiogram showed left ventricle at the upper limits of normal for size , low normal function , moderate to mild effusion with pericardial pressures exceeding right atrial pressures , and right ventricular pressures at various points of patient 's cycle without any change in the effusion from 06/11 .\n",
      "Thoracic Surgery was also consulted and they felt that there was no need for a pericardial window at the time .\n",
      "She should be continued with pulmonary oximetry testing .\n",
      "She underwent her CT scan .\n",
      "This showed lymphangitic spread of cancer in the chest , question of pulmonary nodules in the chest , pericardial effusion , multiple liver metastases , decreased function of the left kidney , dilated left intrarenal collecting system and proximal ureter , and periaortic lymphadenopathy .\n",
      "Pulmonary felt this was consistent also with lymphangitic spread and they did not feel that a bronchoscopy would be of any assistance at this time .\n",
      "Chemotherapy for metastatic cervical cancer was discussed with the patient and she was started on 5-FU 800 mg per meter squared days 06/18 , 06/19 , and 06/20 .\n",
      "She also received Cisplatin 35 per meter squared on 06/19 and Ifex and Mesna on 06/18 .\n",
      "She was noted , on 06/16 , to have numerous erythematous maculopapules on her back and chest .\n",
      "Dermatology was consulted and they felt that this was most likely steroid acne .\n",
      "They therefore felt a rapid steroid taper was indicated and topical Erythromycin if desired by the patient .\n",
      "The patient 's shortness of breath and wheezing continued but without change .\n",
      "Her cardiac examination remained the same and there continued to be no evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "Cardiology felt that follow-up echo was indicated on 06/18 as she had another echocardiogram which showed no change or evidence of tamponade .\n",
      "They therefore felt that she could be continued to be followed by examination .\n",
      "She had some mental status changes with confusion and hallucinations on 06/18 originating from narcotics versus decreased pO2 .\n",
      "The Ifex was held as it was felt that it could have precipitated the mental status changes and that she was to receive no further Ifex .\n",
      "She had no further hallucinations since stopping the Ifex .\n",
      "Psychiatry was also consulted to help her with the changes she was feeling since her new diagnosis .\n",
      "She was hooked up with support services in Collot Ln , Dugo , Indiana 68961 for further counselling and given Xanax for symptoms of anxiety .\n",
      "She continued to have no change in her shortness of breath or cardiac examination and was discharged home on 06/22/91 after completing her 5-FU and Cisplatin chemotherapy .\n",

      "Following the initial catheterization , her hematocrit dropped to 26.5 .\n",
      "She underwent abdominal CT which was negative for retroperitoneal bleed .\n",
      "There was no evidence of GI bleeding , she was transfused one unit prbcs with improvement .\n",
      "She was seen in consultation by the EPS service at the request of family for evaluation of a biventricular pacemaker to improve her quality of life , however she was found not eligible due to a QRS duration less than 0.14 seconds , a right bundle branch configuration , left ventricular aneurysm , and finally an echocardiogram that showed improvement in the left ventricular function , to an EF of 46% .\n",
      "This echo cardiogram continued to show the apical aneurysm .\n",

      "The patient ruled out for MI by cardiac markers .\n",
      "The patient was set to go for a dobutamine stress test on 11/16/04 given her history of COPD , but the stress portion was canceled when she was down there due to fever and hypotension .\n",
      "The next day , she underwent a cardiac echo ( transthoracic echocardiogram ) .\n",
      "This echo showed LV ejection fraction of 50% with no wall motion abnormality .\n",
      "However , the right ventricular was diffusely hypokinetic .\n",
      "It was suboptimally imaged , so there was no RVSP given .\n",
      "The patient also suffered a hypotensive episode while in the endoscopy suite for her EGD on 11/17/04 .\n",
      "This responded to fluid bolus .\n",

      "Clearly , the patient 's hemodynamic vascular status was very sensitive to dobutamine .\n",
      "2. Infectious Disease :\n",
      "On hospital day #2 , the patient was noted to have increased dyspnea on exertion .\n",
      "The next day she developed a fever and she was started on levofloxacin for a potential UTI .\n",
      "She continued to have low-grade fevers and on the next day , 11/17/04 , her chest x-ray showed possible new right upper lobe infiltrates .\n",
      "She was then started on ceftriaxone and azithromycin .\n",
      "Her urine legionella antigen was negative .\n",
      "On 11/22/04 , she was noted to have gram-positive cocci in her sputum .\n",
      "She was started on vancomycin for this .\n",
      "These bacteria turned out to be MRSA and she was continued on her vancomycin .\n",
      "She had PICC line placed on the day prior to discharge for home vancomycin administration .\n",
      "3. GI :\n",
      "The patient had an episode of nausea on the morning of 11/16/04 associated with some cough , apparent emesis .\n",
      "GI was consulted for an EGD , however , while she was in the Endoscopy Suite , as mentioned above , she had a hypotensive episode , which responded to some fluid boluses .\n",
      "Finally , on the day prior to discharge , she was stabilized to the point that she could have her EGD .\n",
      "The EGD did show three esophageal ulcers that were localized and apparent suggestion of pill esophagitis .\n",
      "Her stomach and duodenum were normal and it was suggested that she change her Nexium doses to daily and that she also drink plenty of fluids and water with meals , sit upright when she would eat her meals to decrease the chance of pills eroding her esophagus .\n",
      "4. Shortness of breath :\n",
      "As mentioned above , the patient did develop MRSA pneumonia that was started to be treated with vancomycin and she did also develop an oxygen requirement the day prior to discharge .\n",
      "At most , her oxygen requirement was 4-5 liters and on the day prior to discharge , she was satting well on two liters of nasal cannula .\n",
      "This was thought to be due to her pneumonia ; however , with her right ventricular hypokinesis , it is also possible that she may have an element of pulmonary hypertension and may warrant further investigation as an outpatient , for example , with chest CT .\n",
      "5. Derm :\n",
      "Several days prior to discharge , the patient developed some erythematous rash under her left breast and left side that was thought to be due to yeast .\n",
      "She was started on some Miconazole Cream .\n",
      "The rash was always localized to her left side , sometimes extending down to her leg , but never on the right side .\n",

Patient did quite well and was discharged to her daughter's home approximately 1 week after her surgery.  Prior to her surgeries there was a brief episode where patient was confused and was having trouble speaking, a neuro consultation was called, a CVA was ruled out and it appeared patient may have had changes secondary to medications.

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS: Mr. Qin is a patient of Dr. Potter's, who is in today for urgent care.  He is complaining of a funny sensation in his neck and occasional soreness in his left neck.  Sometimes it hurts worse with breathing.  Sometimes he feels a little catch and a fleeting moment of shortness of breath.  Of note, he was admitted to the hospital last week for these symptoms.  He was admitted, I think 01/15-01/16.  He was ruled out for an MI and actually had a stress test, which showed no evidence of ischemia.  Furthermore, he was monitored the entire time, including while he was having this symptom of a funny feeling in his chest followed by a little shortness of breath or catching his breath as he describes it and no arrhythmia was documented whatsoever.  He was ultimately discharged from the hospital with the diagnosis of Costa chondritis.  He is describing this pain in his left neck and he wonders if it is somehow related to the pain in his chest.  He said he tried gargling with mouthwash some and that did seem to help a little.  This neck or throat pain has been going on for the past three days.\n",

      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Today, he is alert and oriented.  His weight is 255.25 pounds, blood pressure 110/80, pulse 68, temperature 97.4.  Sinuses: Non-tender.  Nasal turbinates: Benign.  Tympanic membranes: With good light reflex, landmarks well seen.  Oropharynx: Without erythema, exudate, edema.  Neck: Supple, without adenopathy.  I am able to locate the spot that's bothering him by pressing on the mid outside of his left neck near where his carotid pulse is, but he does not have a lot of discomfort with this pressure and it does not seem to be quite what he is getting at.  Carotids are 2+ bilaterally.  Lungs: Clear to auscultation and percussion throughout.  Heart: Regular, without murmur, rub or gallop.\n",

      "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  I was unable to find a clear etiology for Mr. Quevedo discomfort, although I think he is probably right that it is related to the musculoskeletal chest pain that he is having.  I did reassure him and tell him that it was okay for him to take ibuprofen for this as he had been directed in the hospital.  He does have an appointment to see Dr. Potter in follow-up in the next couple weeks and he will call or return if any new symptoms develop.\n",

      "She was originally admitted to the Verg Medical Center in January , 1998 , because of a one year history of left sided weakness and spasticity .\n",
      "She was found to have intermedullary lesion at C1-2 level which on biopsy showed abnormal vasculature , hemosiderin deposit , leading in turn to the discovery of a dural arteriovenous malformation at that level which was surgically corrected .\n",

      "HISTORY :\n",
      "The patient is a 74 year old female who was involved in a motor vehicle accident on 11/18/93 at which time her workup revealed a large thoracoabdominal aneurysm at the Eifro Medical Center which was evaluated with a chest X-ray and abdominal CT scan .\n",
      "At that time the patient denied any symptoms of aneurysmal pain and did not suffer significant injury from her motor vehicle accident .\n",
      "She was subsequently referred to Dr. Riode Zetllille for evaluation and workup of her aneurysm .\n",
      "The patient underwent a thoracic abdominal arteriogram on 12/31/93 via a right femoral approach and she was noted to have a large descending aorta with tortuosity but no aneurysmal dilatation of the infrarenal abdominal aorta .\n",
      "The patient was discharged after the procedure was performed and subsequently admitted in this hospitalization for elective resection .\n",
      "Since the patient 's last admission she gives no history of chest or back pain and continues to be quite active .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "On physical examination she is a well developed female in no distress .\n",
      "Her head and neck examination is within normal limits .\n",
      "Her lungs were clear to auscultation .\n",
      "Her lung and pericardic examination is regular rate and rhythm .\n",
      "Her abdomen was soft , nontender , nondistended .\n",
      "She has a pulsatile upper abdominal mass .\n",
      "Extremities :\n",
      "are well perfused and she has a small left inguinal hernia .\n",
      "She has a well healed right groin scar and pulse examination reveals 2 plus pulses from the carotids through the posterior tibial arteries bilaterally .\n",
      "Neurologically she is awake and alert , she has normal cranial nerve function and her motor examination is within normal limits .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "Is remarkable for normal serum electrolytes with creatinine 1.2 , hematocrit 31.9 and normal coagulation studies .\n",
      "EKG reveals a normal sinus rhythm , normal intervals with slight left ventricular hypertrophy repolarization abnormality .\n",
      "Her chest X-ray is remarkable only for a tortuous aorta on the anterior projection .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted and underwent resection and grafting of a thoracoabdominal aneurysm which she tolerated well .\n",
      "There were no intraoperative complications .\n",
      "She was taken to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit postoperatively .\n",
      "The patient 's procedure was also remarkable for the fact that she underwent spinal cooling during this procedure .\n",
      "The patient remained intubated postoperatively .\n",
      "She had a stable first postoperative day without evidence of hemodynamic or cardiopulmonary deterioration .\n",
      "On postoperative day 1 she had a slight hematocrit drop to 27.2 which was expected with hydration in addition to intraoperative volume loss but otherwise had an unremarkable course .\n",
      "Epidural anesthesia was used throughout her course for pain management and she was transferred to the Surgical floor on postoperative day two .\n",
      "The patient developed an episode of atrial fibrillation with physical examination consistent with only mild cardiopulmonary congestion as manifested by bilateral scattered rales in the lung fields .\n",
      "Serum electrolytes at the time revealed normal potassium levels and the patient was treated with p.r.n. verapamil and digoxin therapy for a heart rate varying between 80 and 110 .\n",
      "The patient 's oxygen saturations continued to maintain at levels greater than 95 percent and this was felt to be well controlled and she was placed on digoxin chronically and also diuresed for therapy .\n",
      "She was transferred to the Surgical floor where on postoperative day three she began to complain of hypersensitivity in the left lower extremity and inability to move her toes .\n",
      "This was a new finding considering postoperatively she had full motor and sensory function of all four extremities .\n",
      "Neurologic assessment at the time did in fact reveal profound paresis of the left lower extremity only with absent reflexes but hyperesthesia to light touch throughout the lower extremities .\n",
      "Laboratory data obtained revealed no significant changes from her initial postoperative levels .\n",
      "Neurological consultation was obtained .\n",
      "It was felt that the patient had been subjected significant cord ischemia and possibly this neurologic event also related to spinal or epidural catheter placement .\n",
      "The epidural catheter had been removed prior to their evaluation and no return of significant function was noted over the ensuing two days aside from flexion and extension of the toes but still the patient maintained profound proximal lower extremity weakness .\n",
      "MRI obtained did not reveal evidence of a structural cause for cord or root dysfunction and further recommendation of abdominal CT scanning in addition to EMGs and SSEPs to further evaluate and confirm the site of the lesion be performed .\n",
      "The patient continued to do well otherwise being slowly progressed in her diet and mobilized from bed to chair without difficulty .\n",
      "She was placed on a bowel regimen to alleviate signs and symptoms of constipation while the workup to determine the exact etiology of her left lower extremity paresis could be identified .\n",
      "Continued supportive care was performed for the patient as again she manifested no other significant signs of hemodynamic or neurologic deterioration .\n",
      "Her ultimate diagnosis was subsequently felt to be a segmental infarction of the anterior and lateral part of her T10 level spinal cord and there was no evidence of that recovery of her left lower extremity would be obtained .\n",
      "Social Service consultation for rehabilitation placement was performed .\n",
      "The patient understands the ramifications of her disability and continued neurologic assessment is to be made .\n",
      "The patient continued to make slight gains in motor movement of the left lower extremity as manifested by digital function and some knee jerk return and by postoperative day eight she was manifesting some dorsiflexion in addition to urodynamics being performed revealed good detrusion contraction , normal sensation and a coordinated sphincter which suggested no disability to the sympathetic control of her bowel and bladder .\n",
      "The patient complained of some urinary incontinence and urgency on the 10th postoperative day .\n",
      "She was placed on Bactrim therapy for E. coli positive urine culture and EMG performed revealed a lesion proximal in the central nervous system ( CNS ) consistent with central lesions .\n",
      "Additional neurological follow-up will be maintained as the patient continues to rehabilitate in the On Modenyheatl Rowbrook Of Medical Center .\n",
      "It is at this point encouraging that she continues to slowly regain some motor function of the left lower extremity but the patient has been advised that this may in fact not return .\n",

      "We saw Anthony Vigil in the Internal Medicine at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/09/2087.  He underwent orthotopic heart transplant at the Dixmont State Hospital on 03/30/2084 and returns now for his annual evaluation.  In the interval since last seen, he has done reasonably well.  His last annual evaluation at Lorain Community Hospital revealed an ejection fraction of 55% by echocardiography and no coronary disease, although left anterior descending was tortuous.  Filling pressures were normal, then with a wedge of 15 and a right atrial pressure of 9 while the pulmonary artery pressure was 30/19 with a mean of 25.  The patient does have a herniated disk at L4 and stenosis at L5.  He has lower extremity cramps, which potentially due to his spine disease have been markedly exacerbated by Pravachol.  The Pravachol was therefore stopped, restarted, and stopped again.  He continues to take insulin and his last hemoglobin A1c was 6.6.  He has had two recent episodes of mild hypoglycemia.  He has had no dermatologic evaluation.  He denies angina, congestive heart failure, or arrhythmias.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Physical Examination:  Reveals a weight of 183 pounds, blood pressure of 121/71, pulse of 100.  Jugular venous pressure is 8 cm of water.  Carotid upstrokes are brisk without bruits.  There are diminished breath sounds in the left lung.  Point of maximum impulse is not displaced.  First heart sound is normal, second crisp and clear.  He has an S4 at the left sternal border.  The abdomen is without hepatosplenomegaly.  There is no peripheral edema.  Peripheral pulses are diminished.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The electrocardiogram reveals a right bundle-branch block pattern with an intrinsic rate of 98 beats per minute.  There are nonspecific T-wave changes particularly in the early precordium.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Current Medications:  Calcium with D 1250 mg twice per day, Cardura 4 mg, CellCept 1000 mg twice per day, diltiazem CD 240 mg twice per day, Ecotrin 81 mg per day, Lantus insulin 26 units at night, magnesium oxide 400 mg twice per day, vitamin, cyclosporine 100 mg twice per day, Neurontin 100 mg twice per day, NovoLog insulin as needed, prednisone 5 mg per day, vitamins C 500 mg twice per day, and vitamin E 400 units twice per day.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Impression:  The patient will undergo his annual evaluation over the next 24 hours.  This will include blood work, chest x-ray, echocardiogram, metabolic exercise stress test, cardiac catheterization, coronary angiography, and endomyocardial biopsy.  We will see him after completion of these studies and review the results with him.  We will transmit the results to you as well at that time.\n",

      "She was admitted and put on intravenous antibiotics with plan of obtaining an abdominopelvic CT scan .\n",
      "On the day of admission , an abdominopelvic CAT scan was obtained which showed dilated loops of fluid filled bowel and colon in the right lower quadrant .\n",
      "The colon was decompressed distally and there was no contrast seen in the lower intestine .\n",
      "This was thought to represent at least a partial small bowel obstruction or possibly an ileus .\n",

      "At this time , on hospital day one with a diagnosis of perforated appendicitis and right lower quadrant phlegmon , it was felt that this course of action would be to either proceed with surgery or attempt to stabilize the patient with intravenous fluids , antibiotics , and possibly wait for six weeks for elective appendectomy .\n",
      "The patient was started on triple antibiotics of ampicillin , Gentamicin , and Flagyl , kept NPO , and serial examinations were obtained .\n",

      "Sips of clear liquids were started and were tolerated without complication .\n",
      "Patient 's physical examination remained relatively unremarkable , however , she began to develop slight abdominal distention .\n",
      "After the patient was tolerating clear sips , she was given one liter of Golytely with the intention of clearing out her bowel in case surgery was needed .\n",
      "Repeat CAT scan was obtained on hospital day five .\n",
      "This CAT scan was relatively unchanged showing matted loops of bowel in the right lower quadrant .\n",
      "The appendix was not well visualized .\n",
      "The repeat CT scan also showed contained fluid collections in the pelvis and these were not felt to be communicating .\n",
      "These were also not felt to be collections which could be drained by interventional radiology .\n",
      "Given the progression of the patient 's CAT scan and the relative nonprogression of her clinical course , the decision was made after discussion with the patient to proceed with exploratory laparotomy and likely ileocecectomy with secondary wound closure .\n",
      "Patient 's bowel was further prepared with p.o. erythromycin and neomycin base in one additional liter of Golytely .\n",
      "She experienced extreme nausea and vomiting with the erythromycin and neomycin .\n",
      "On December 3 , 1997 , the patient was taken to the Operating Room and under general anesthesia , she underwent an exploratory laparotomy , drainage of intraabdominal abscesses , and appendectomy by Dr. Zamorryn He .\n",
      "No ileocecectomy was performed .\n",
      "Cultures were taken of the peritoneal fluid .\n",
      "These peritoneal fluid cultures subsequently grew E. coli and coagulase negative Staphylococcus .\n",

      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "Of note - Na 133 , K 4 , WBC 8.82 , hematocrit 35.1 , platelets 229 .\n",
      "PT 13.8 with an INR of 1.3 , PTT 25.5 , total protein was 6.2 , albumin 3.4 , globulin of 2.8 , calcium of 9.1 , phos 2.7 , mag 2.1 , urea 3.7 .\n",

      "Cholesterol 188 , triglyceride was 127 .\n",
      "UA - trace protein , trace ketones , positive for bilirubin and nitrogen and also 4 to 6 wbcs with 1+ bacteria .\n",
      "Chest x-ray - Showed a left paratracheal adenopathy and small left pleural effusion with no evidence of pneumonia .\n",
      "In summary , the patient is a 49 year old woman with metastatic breast cell CA , status post chemotherapy with CMSAP and PVSC and XRT who presented with fever , four days of diarrhea , nausea and vomiting and had been on Keflex for an erythema on her left chest wall .\n",
      "The Keflex was stopped when she developed the diarrhea .\n",
      "When she arrived the plan was to go ahead and treat here rythematous induration and possible cellulitis with IV antibiotics .\n",
      "So she was put on dicloxicillin and we did local wound care with an agent called Santyl , which is a collagenace ondebrided which worked very well for her .\n",
      "Also at the time of admission we were also considering palliative Taxol chemotherapy , which the patient declined .\n",
      "She refused the Taxol therapy so that was not done .\n",
      "Another major issue with this patient was pain control .\n",
      "She had been in a whole lot of pain from her left arm lesion .\n",
      "So pain control was a big issue so she was on MS Contin and MSIR at home she thought that clouded her thinking , so we tried different things for pain management .\n",
      "One of them was to do a subarachnoid neurologic block at C6-C7 interface on 1-6-94 .\n",
      "After that the patient had minimal relief of pain .\n",
      "However , she declined further blocks , which were offered to her .\n",
      "So accepted to be on dilaudid p.o. which was started at a dosage of 2-4 meg but since then we have tapered it up .\n",
      "She is now getting dilaudid 8 mg q2h and in addition she has been on fentanyl patch .\n",
      "She is now getting 75 micrograms per hour of the fentanyl patch which is changed every 72 hours .\n",
      "We can go up by 25 mg on the fentanyl patch as needed to control her pain and we can always go up on the dilaudid because she is still in considerable amount of pain .\n",
      "Other things that happened during this admission - we obtained ahead CT for her on the 8th of January because of her clouded thinking and altered mental status , which was probably due to the morphine that she was taking .\n",
      "We went ahead and got a head CT scanand it showed no enhancing lesions .\n",
      "In addition her liver transaminases were elevated , we thought about doing further work-up , but that was deferred because the patient wanted to wait on that .\n",
      "That has been stable .\n",
      "The patient on January 13 became hyponatremic .\n",
      "Her sodium went down to 121 and before that on admission she was 133 .\n",
      "A renal consult was obtained and their assessment was that this was probably a mixture of hypovolemia as well as SIADH .\n",
      "We proceeded to do for her hyponatremia - we gave her some fluid and her urine sodium became higher than her serum sodium ; we stopped it .\n",
      "We had given her some normal saline and then we proceeded to just do fluid restriction .\n",
      "In addition we gave her a sodium chloride one gram per day and that also helped , so that now at the time of discharge , the patient 's sodium is between 126 and 129 ; prior to that it had gone down to as low 116.\n",
      "So that has really improved .\n",
      "We suggest continuing increased salt intake in her diet and also continuing with the fluid restriction of free water intake to one liter per day .\n",
      "On the 14th of January , the patient developed increased shortness of breath and chest x-ray was taken showed a wedge shaped infiltrate in the right upper lobe which was consistent with Hampton 's hump .\n",
      "Also a VQ scan obtained the next day showed high probability for PE .\n",
      "So we proceeded to put her on heparin for anticoagulation and then when she was therapeutic on heparin , we went ahead and started her on coumadin and she is currently on coumadin at 2.5 mg q.h.s.\n",
      "Her INR is 2.3 .\n",
      "We want her INR to remain between 2 and 3 .\n",
      "So if it goes much lower than 2 , then we would consider increasing it to perhaps coumadin 2.5 and 5 alternating every other night .\n",
      "However , we would leave it at 2.5 for now .\n",
      "Other major issues - As a result of all the things happened and with her hyponatremia and also the other problems , her blood pressure was elevated also .\n",
      "We put her on nifedipine IR , SL and that was not enough to control her blood pressure which was in the 200s in the systolic , so we had started her on atenolol .\n",
      "So on discharge she is on atenolol 100 .\n",
      "If needed to you can give her some nifedipine SL to decrease her blood pressure .\n",
      "The patient also has significant edema in both arms now and also some mild edema in the lower extremities , so I think that fluid restriction should help with that .\n",
      "She is also a little dry .\n",
      "The patient is on oxygen .\n",
      "Ever since the pulmonary embolus she has been on oxygen .\n",
      "She was on 4 liters ; now she is on 5 liters , sating 94 to 96% on 5 liters .\n",
      "We would like for her to remain on the oxygen as well .\n",
      "The complications that I have listed include the hyponatremia , pulmonary embolus and also the elevatd blood pressure .\n",
      "DISPOSITION :\n",
      "Discharge medications - Baclofen 10 p.o. t.i.d. , MVI one tablet p.o. q.d. , Mycostatin powder TP q.d. to be applied to the rash in her left groin area , also dilaudid 8 mg p.o. q2h , Colace 100 mg p.o. b.i.d. , coumadin 2.5 mg p.o. q.h.s. fentanyl patch 75 micrograms per hour topical q72 hours , atenolol 100 mg p.o. q.d.\n",

He is requiring to eat out quite a bit.  He has also done a large amount of traveling over the last three to four months.  This caused him to be more exhausted than usual.

He has slightly elevated fasting blood sugars.  We discussed options including diet and exercise which I think he has been very good on.  Discussed starting metformin based on recent data that this may help prevent his development of diabetes.  We will begin metformin 500 mg PO QD.  We will check his renal and liver function in one week and his bruising is likely due to his aspirin.  We need to follow up on a renal ultrasound for cysts that were discovered during his hernia operation, and I will make these arrangements.

      "X-rays were reviewed .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Please refer to the operative note by Dr. Etteme Overall for details of the procedure .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient was transferred to the floor in stable condition for observation , pain control and mobilization .\n",
      "Initially postoperatively , she was doing quite well , though she did require four liters of oxygen postoperatively to maintain her oxygen saturations .\n",
      "It was hoped that she would wean off the oxygen over the course of the next few hours .\n",
      "However , she did require four liters of oxygen all the way through the night to maintain oxygen saturations of 93% .\n",
      "Without oxygen , she dropped down to the low 80s .\n",
      "Given the unusual nature of this oxygen requirement , the patient underwent work-up with a chest X-ray , which essentially was normal .\n",
      "An ABG revealed a normal PCO2 of 32 , but a decrease in PO2- at 62 .\n",
      "Therefore , given her history of breast cancer , the patient was taken for a spiral CT scan and the Medicine Service was consulted at that time .\n",
      "They agreed with our plan .\n",
      "On spiral CT scan , a small pulmonary embolus was seen in the right upper lobe and the left low er lobe .\n",
      "She was started on heparin at that time to maintain a PTT of 60 t o 80 , and was given doses of Coumadin , in addition to the Coumadin she had been given for DVT prophylaxis .\n",
      "With the recommendation of the medicine te am , we decided to maintain an INR of 2 to 3 with an overlap of heparin when the patient was therapeutic for two to three days .\n",
      "She continued to do quite well even though we did keep her on bed rest for three days while she was heparinized .\n",
      "Her oxygen saturations continued to improve to the point that she was on room air on postoperative day four with oxygen saturation of 95% .\n",
      "She was given perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis for 48 hours after surgery .\n",
      "She was mobilized on postoperative day four , getting out of bed , able to do quite well on her new hip with a minimal amount of pain .\n",
      "She was given posterior hip dislocation precautions at that time , which she understood quite well .\n",
      "She continued to be followed by the medical team and was watched very closely by the orthopedic team until we felt comfortable that she was breathing quite well and was mobilizing well with physical therapy .\n",
      "Therefore , it was decided at that time that the patient was ready for discharge to rehabilitation on Coumadin , which would be monitored for six months to maintain an INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "The patient will continue all of her pre-admission medications , though no nonsteroidal analgesics , e.g. , aspirin or ibuprofen , will be given while she is on Coumadin therapy .\n",
      "1. Colace , 100 mg. PO t.i.d.\n",
      "2. Percocet , one to two tablets PO q.3 to 4 hours p.r.n. pain .\n",
      "3. Coumadin with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "Please prescribe 2 mg. tablets .\n",
      "The patient will be on Coumadin for six months given her history of pulmonary embolus .\n",
      "DISCHARGE PLAN :\n",
      "Coumadin for six months postoperatively with a target INR of 2.0 to 3.0 .\n",
      "Check INR three times a week until stable .\n",
      "Please call the results to Dr. Viennee Ester , the patient 's primary-care physician , who has agreed to follow her INR levels for the remainder of the six months .\n",
      "Dr. Viennee Ester is located in Tlandcousti Lo Vuclark , where the patient is from originally .\n",
      "The patient will call Dr. Overall 's office to arrange a follow-up appointment six weeks from the day of surgery .\n",
      "Staples can be removed 10 to 14 days postoperatively .\n",
      "Please hold removal if the wound is draining .\n",
      "The patient may shower once the incision is dry , and may bathe and / or swim after the staples have been removed and there is no wound drainage .\n",
      "Partial weight-bearing with crutches or a walker with posterior hip dislocation precautions for three months following surgery .\n",

      "Assessment:: Likely Communicating Hydrocephalus with mild elevation of ICP in context of minor head trauma.  On exam shows psychomotor retardation, d/w concentration, retrieval (including memory and words), frontal fucntions including set-switching on Lurias, and working memory. He also has moderate retropulsion on exam worse on pull-test than spontaneously, and hypomimia. His vents are mildly dilated in context of general cerebral atrophy that is not o/w out-of-proportion for his advanced age. Onset of his sx's including bilateral headache described as constant 6-8/10 pressure at posterior vertex w/ occ. radiation foward made worse by lying down for some time (worse in the mornings) and better in the afternoons or after sitting or standing. No blurred vision but mild nausea w/o vomiting. No nuchal rigidity or photo-phonophobia. No f/c/ns/cp/sob/rash/weakness/changes in sensation. Describes very clear psychomotor retardation since first fall including d/w concentraion, memory and word retrieval, and extreme slowness in mental processing (including reading - used to be a speed reader and now reads one word at a time very slowly). He's had some urinary urgency but no incontinencey. Describes his d/w gait as not being able to get his legs to do what he wants them to do despite having good strength. Additionally, feels that he's always losing his balance backwards. No suggestion of meningoencephalitis, stroke or seizure. Had mild bilat tinnitus but no vertigo. Does ascribe rare very transient visual distortion and object movement (up/down). WBC mildly elevated but no fever and U/A and CXR are negative. \n",

Has a mild small and large fiber distal symmetric polyneuropathy which exacerbates his gait difficulties. He is also at least mildly anxious and moderately anxious.

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Riie Pruesschird is a 25 year-old gentleman with metastatic angiosarcoma who presents as a transfer from Nacalv Medical Center with a fever to 101 , vomiting times one and \" left kidney pain \" .\n",
      "This patient is an unfortunate young gentleman who was initially diagnosed with a germ cell tumor in the fall of 1997 after undergoing orchiectomy with a left scrotal mass and underwent three cycles of DEP therapy for pulmonary involvement .\n",
      "In the summer of 1998 he was found to have a retroperitoneal mass which ultimately revealed angiosarcoma of presumed germ-cell transformation .\n",
      "In early 1999 he underwent resection of this mass however in February of 1999 he was found to have a new right pleural mass and subsequently underwent pleurodesis and chemotherapy with ifosfamide and Adriamycin for six cycles .\n",
      "In 05/99 he had increasing abdominal pain and evaluation revealed extensive progressive retroperitoneal disease as well as left hydronephrosis .\n",
      "In early 2000 he was started on therapy with Taxol per Dr. Azel Hibbskays and finished this in March of this year .\n",
      "CT imaging at that time was negative for disease .\n",
      "In April of this year , he was found to have acute renal failure with left hydronephrosis and this was treated with percutaneous nephrostomy tube on that side .\n",
      "Thereafter he began chemotherapy with Taxotere in 05/13 and his nephrostomy tube was removed after being displaced on 06/14/00 .\n",
      "Most recently he has had problems with nausea , vomiting , fever and left sided abdominal pain and was admitted to the Pointexasp Region General Hospital on 06/16/00 .\n",
      "That hospital course was sign for hydration , antibiotics for questionable pneumonia and more importantly , tachycardia and respiratory distress ultimately secondary to a large left pulmonary arterial mass that was likely a thrombus .\n",
      "He was treated with intra-arterial thrombolysis ( TPA ) and was discharged on 06/28/00 on high dose , low molecular weight Heparin .\n",
      "It was entirely clear that this mass represents a clot , certainly this could have been tumor embolization .\n",
      "Finally , the patient developed hyponatremia with a sodium down to 130 and was otherwise eventually discharged to Pre Health with morphine for comfort care and advanced care plans , not to be resuscitated in the event of a life-threatening situation .\n",

The thecal sac and the cauda quina were, however, intact. He was started in early February on bicalutamide and was scheduled to have a Zoladex injection, but his pain became more and more severe, and ultimately he was admitted to the LMH last week where I first met him.

I do not want to have to use exteremely high doses of gabapentin to spare narcotics because he is not a drug seeker and I want him to be comfortable and he has no congnitive problems with safe adminstration or dosing.  His PSA is low and will continue to follow.  If his pain is at night which sometimes it is, he could have a component of restless legs from arterial insufficiency, will check PVRs anyway to rule that out\n",

      "3. DM- will email me his sugars and will adjust oral agents as necessary,. He needs U/a for microalb, eas encourgagd to wear shoes in house, will check PVrs, will start low dose lisinopril for BP and prevention of diabetic nephropathy and heck creatinine and K one week after starting the medicaiton.

      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "This is one of several Ponta,itri- University Medical Center admissions for this 74-year old female with multiple medical problems who developed multiple myeloma with bench Jones proteinuria over one year ago .\n",
      "There were lytic lesions seen in her bones and the patient was started on intermittent courses of melphalan with Prednisone .\n",
      "She had a partial response , but continued to have inappropriate amounts of gamma globulins in her blood and urine and remained anemic and poorly responsive to erythropoietin .\n",
      "The patient has had one previous admission for the same symptoms a couple of months ago that she came in with this time , namely generalized weakness which in fact has on both occasions been accompanied by progressively worsening renal insufficiency .\n",
      "The weakness is non focal although since she has had chronic problems with pain in her legs for uncertain reasons she was having difficulty walking .\n",
      "Her appetite was gone .\n",
      "She was having some nausea .\n",
      "No recent history of a change in her medicines or lapse in them .\n",
      "No changes in her breathing .\n",
      "She did not seem sleepy or confused .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "blood pressure 130/40 , heart rate 78 regular .\n",
      "Weight 132 , ( had been 126 one year previously ) .\n",
      "Temperature 97 .\n",
      "The patient was pale with a fine tremor of her upper extremities .\n",
      "She could walk hesitantly for a few steps , was anicteric , lucid , not tachypneic .\n",
      "She has flat affect at baseline and does not give may clues about somatic distress when she has some .\n",
      "Her lungs were clear .\n",
      "heart ; without murmur or gallop .\n",
      "Her jugular venous pressure was four to five centimeters of water , carotid upstrokes normal .\n",
      "soft , non tender abdomen with normal bowel sounds .\n",
      "No hepatosplenomegaly or masses .\n",
      "She had 2+ edema of the ankles without tender cords or erythema .\n",
      "She was moving all four extremities .\n",
      "Her cranial nerves were grossly intact to inspection .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "Hematocrit 24.6 , white count 4.0 , platelet count 170,000 , normal differential , sodium 143 , potassium 5.7 , chloride 113 , carbon dioxide 18.9 , BUN and creatinine 71/5.2 , glucose 177 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Ponta,itri- University Medical Center as a front door admission and although her electrocardiogram is equivocal , a second potassium also came back elevated so she was treated with two doses of sodium K-exulate with improvement of her potassium to within normal limits .\n",
      "Over the following days , she was gently hydrated .\n",
      "Her urine was alkalinized using intravenous and later oral sodium bicarbonate and her creatinine rose to a high of about 5.8 .\n",
      "She was seen by the nephrology service and it was deemed quite likely that the acute and chronic renal insufficiency that had progressed causing this admission was related to her myeloma kidney .\n",
      "In the weeks prior to admission she had just begun thalidomide orally as a salvage treatment for her myeloma .\n",
      "She tolerated without sedation but probably was not at a therapeutic dose and it had had no impact by the time of her admission .\n",
      "The patient , her son Randdor So and I had several long conversations about the potential for further renal deterioration and need for hemodialysis .\n",
      "The family and the patient felt quite clearly that hemodialysis was not indicated if the underlying myeloma was not controllable .\n",
      "They did agree , however to one more attempt at pulse Decadron therapy with consists of oral Decadron forty mgs PO q.day ( in divided doses ) for four consecutive days followed by four days off , followed by four days on , etc. for a total of eight sessions of four days of Decadron on .\n",
      "By the time she had left she had completed only the first of the four consecutive days as expected her blood sugars went up into high 300's or 400s and she needed sliding scale regular insulin in addition to standing doses of NPH .\n",
      "On the days when she was not on Decadron the standing doses of NPH were sometimes suspended because her blood sugars would get to 41 and she would have remarkably few symptoms in this setting , perhaps related to the low dose beta blockers that she also takes .\n",
      "There had been a slight down turn in her creatinine by discharge to 4.7 but there was concern that she could not tolerate any greater hydration rates due to crackles in her bases although her jugular venous pressure went about six and she was never symptomatic with fluid overload .\n",
      "Potassium did not appear to be a problem throughout the rest of her hospitalization .\n",
      "She was also seen by the pain service who was baffled by the cause for her lower extremity leg pain that has been present for several years , not progressive , minimally responsive to narcotics and currently on a second trial of Neurontin of dubious value and would probably by the first medicine that I discontinue if she was feeling too sleepy or weak .\n",
      "The problem may be a combination of degenerative joint disease with spinal stenosis as well as neuropathic changes from diabetes +/- her myeloma .\n",
      "The patient also requested to be do not resuscitate , do not intubate and this was also in agreement with her son So .\n",
      "The patient is transferred to a skilled nursing facility to continue the pulses of Decadron under close monitoring for blood sugars insulin regulation and to see that her potassium does not worsen and that perhaps her creatinine will improve a slight bit more , although probably not come back to normal .\n",
      "She will finish her last planned pulse of Decadron by about November 25 , 2003 at which point depending on her creatinine and her status we may or may not elect further such treatments .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "1. heparin 5000 units subQ b.i.d.\n",
      "2. clonazepam 0.5 mgs PO q.h.s.\n",
      "3. risperidone 3 mgs PO q.h.s.\n",
      "4. regular insulin on a sliding scale as detailed in discharge medication orders , but essentially no insulin for blood sugars less than 200 but from 201 to 250 give four units subQ , 251 to 300 give six units subQ , from 301 to 350 give eight units subQ , from 351 to 400 give ten units subQ , and if over 400 give twelve units subQ.\n",
      "she also has standing doses of insulin NPH ten in the morning , ten in the evening and tentatively these will only be used during the days of high Decadron and perhaps should not be used on the days without Decadron .\n",

      "She is to undergo an angiogram when her coagulation profile allows .\n",
      "She has been on Coumadin .\n",
      "We will check her coags before heparinizing , and she will go to angiography when her prothrombin time comes within an acceptable range .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "The patient was seen by Dr. Tomedankell Flowayles of Cardiology who recommended that , if she were to undergo an operative procedure , that she first have a coronary perfusion scan .\n",
      "The patient was also seen by Dr. Breutz of the GI Service who assessed her as not needing colonoscopy or a GI series at this time .\n",
      "She was also seen by the Stroke Service who noted that a recent magnetic resonance angiogram had reportedly shown a right common carotid artery occlusion .\n",
      "They also noted that a careful elicitation of her visual symptoms seemed possibly consistent more with migraine than with ischemia .\n",
      "They recommended that she have a baseline head computerized tomographyscan , agreed with obtaining an angiogram and recommended trying a trial of migraine therapy to see if ocular symptoms resolved .\n",
      "Meanwhile the patient was heparinized .\n",
      "Her prothrombin time came down and , on 11/15/96 , she underwent angiography .\n",
      "This showed :\n",
      "1. a patent aorto innominate left common carotid graft .\n",
      "2. an occluded right common carotid artery , right internal carotid and reconstitution of a short segment of right external carotid from the left vertebral .\n",
      "3. a mild stenosis of the right proximal subclavian artery .\n",
      "4. mild stenosis of the right vertebral origin .\n",
      "5. apatent left common carotid , left internal carotid , status post left carotid endarterectomy .\n",
      "6. an occluded left external carotid .\n",
      "7. a patent left subclavian proximally , occluded left axillary artery with reconstitution ofthe left brachial artery .\n",
      "8. moderate to severe stenosis of the left vertebral origin .\n",
      "9. right cerebral hemisphere fills from the left vertebral and the left internal carotid .\n",
      "Given these angiographic findings , which were not amenable to surgery , the patient was weaned from heparin , restarted on Coumadin , and was discharged today , 11/18/96 , with therapeutic protime .\n",
      "In retrospect , her symptoms may have been surrounding the final thrombosis of her right carotid .\n",
      "A perfusion scan was not necessary as no surgical procedure was entertained .\n",
      "An I-head computerized tomography scan done on 11/16/96 showed two areas of old infarction without evidence of a recent infarct or bleed .\n",
      "Both the old infarcts were in the right hemisphere , # 1 in the frontal lobe nad # 2 around the centrum semi ovale .\n",

      "Barium Enema showed diverticula .\n",
      "He was doing well on the Surgical Service until 04/08/93 when he experienced the acute onset of dyspnea and desaturation .\n",
      "He was intubated and transferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further evaluation and management .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "He ruled in for myocardial infarction by EKG and enzyme criteria .\n",
      "In the Medical Intensive Care Unit , his do not resuscitate status was clarified by his legal guardian .\n",
      "It was Mr. Fyfeguayfalc 's wish to not be resuscitated , no intubation , no pressors , and no defibrillation .\n",
      "He was extubated on the evening of 04/08/93 and was transferred to Loui Dingspar Chepidster Medical Center the morning of 04/09/93 .\n",
      "At approximately 1:10 p.m. , he experienced the abrupt onset of increased dyspnea with O2 saturation in the seventies while eating lunch .\n",
      "He became tachypneic and confused with labored breathing and a respiratory rate in the thirties .\n",
      "He was placed on 100% non-rebreather with O2 saturation of 79% .\n",
      "Blood pressure was 172/70 .\n",
      "He was given one sublingual Nifedipine , a total of 4 mg of Morphine , and 20 mg of Lasix without significant result .\n",
      "Arterial blood gas showed a pH of 7.19 , pCO2 74 , pO2 50 , and O2 saturation of 73% .\n",
      "Chest X-Ray showed a right middle lobe infiltrate which was new , a left lower lobe infiltrate , and no edema .\n",
      "Lungs had scattered rhonchi with little air movement .\n",
      "He was suctioned with return of food particles , presumed aspiration .\n",
      "His O2 saturation remained in the sixties to seventies despite repeated nebulizers and suctioning .\n",
      "A decision was made to not bronchoscope the patient because of his do not resuscitate status .\n",
      "He expired on 04/09/93 at 2:25 p.m.\n",

      "The patient has no known drug allergies .\n",
      "REVIEW OF SYSTEMS :\n",
      "The review of systems was negative .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "The physical examination was unremarkable .\n",
      "Pulses were 2+ and symmetrical throughout bilaterally without bruits .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the hospital on 9-8-94 ( please note that there is a discrepancy in dates here-transcriptionist ) and underwent his renal transplantation on the EXWAGH9T protocol .\n",
      "His operative course was unremarkable and postoperatively , he did well until he developed some constipation and abdominal distention several days postoperatively .\n",
      "He then developed massive dilatation of the cecum which was treated with multiple endoscopies and rectal tube placement .\n",
      "During this time , he never developed a fever , leukocytosis , or peritoneal signs .\n",
      "Despite these efforts and despite the lack of physical signs , on the day of the operation , he experienced a popping sensation in his abdomen while he was walking and then the onset of mild diffuse abdominal pain .\n",
      "An X-ray at the time revealed free air .\n",
      "The patient was therefore brought to the Operating Room where he was found to have a perforated sigmoid colon with gross soilage of the peritoneal cavity .\n",
      "He was further found to have what appeared to be an area of diverticulitis with abscess formation in his sigmoid colon .\n",
      "He therefore underwent a subtotal colectomy with Hartman pouch creation and ileostomy creation .\n",
      "The subsequent pathology report confirmed the initial impression that this was indeed diverticulitis in the setting of diverticulosis and acute and chronic inflammation with abscess formation in the sigmoid colon .\n",
      "The patient continued to improve postoperatively and had essentially an unremarkable course with the exception that his creatinine became elevated .\n",
      "A renal biopsy was then performed which failed to show signs of rejection .\n",
      "It was therefore felt that his elevation in creatinine was multifactorial related to the events surrounding surgery and the surgery itself .\n",
      "With just observation alone , his creatinine returned to a level of 2.0 by the time of discharge .\n",
      "At the time of this dictation , the patient is doing quite well , eating , ambulating , and taking his medications .\n",
      "The patient was discharged home in stable condition and will follow up with the clinic .\n",
      "It is anticipated that in three to four months , we will consider taking him back to the operating room to perform an ileostomy take-down .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient did develop atrial fibrillation which was felt to be related to electrolyte disturbances as well as perioperative stress .\n",
      "He ruled out for myocardial infarction .\n",
      "An echocardiogram revealed a dilated left atrium at 5 centimeters and left ventricular concentric hypertrophy without any evidence of wall motion abnormalities .\n",
      "A Holter monitor showed only atrial premature contractions .\n",
      "The patient was seen in consultation and evaluated by Cardiology and in the end , he was well controlled on digoxin , Propanolol , and verapamil .\n",
      "Again , he does have a history of paroxysmal atrial tachycardia for which he came in the hospital with verapamil treatment .\n",
      "He did have some postoperative hypertension which was controlled with Cardura and sublingual nifedipine prn .\n",

      "Prostate specific antigen increased from 77.9 to 88 , and the patient also had urinary incontinence and body weight loss .\n",
      "Further evaluation of his renal failure showed that the patient has bilateral hydronephrosis , most likely obstructive uropathy due to prostate CA in the pelvic area .\n",
      "Because of the increasing creatinine to 8.0 on February 28 , 1999 , a left nephrostomy tube was placed .\n",
      "However after the procedure , the patient 's hematocrit dropped to 24 and he was transfused two units of packed red blood cells .\n",
      "His hematocrit increased to about 30 , but he continued to have hematuria and his renal function only improved very slowly .\n",
      "He also received Kayexalate for hyperkalemia .\n",

      "Stenosis of porcine aortic valve with fibrous pannus formation , coronary disease , status post aortic valve replacement and coronary artery bypass grafting , manic depressive disorder , left ventricular dysfunction , question of basilar artery migraine .\n",
      "PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n",
      "4-2-93 , right and left heart catheterization ( transeptal ) with coronary graft and left ventriculogram .\n",
      "4-8-93 , open heart aortic valve replacement and bypass of right coronary artery .\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Mr. No is a 65 year old male who , in 1986 , had a coronary artery bypass grafting procedure at Noughwell Entanbon Health in Stoningi , Kansas .\n",
      "This involved construction of an internal mammary graft from the left internal mammary artery to the left circumflex , a right internal mammary was anastomosed to the anterior descending and diagonal branch , and a saphenous vein was constructed to the right coronary artery .\n",
      "He did well , but appeared here in 1991 with high grade aortic stenosis , and an ejection fraction of only 23% .\n",
      "He underwent aortic valve replacement with a porcine valve by Dr. G Hemp .\n",
      "Following this , he was followed closely by Dr. Brown in Na .\n",
      "Over the last several months , he has had a recurrence of his congestive heart failure and an echocardiogram performed by Dr. Brown suggested the possibility of the development of aortic stenosis .\n",
      "He also was having some chest tightness , as well as increasing shortness of breath .\n",
      "The patient was referred here for further evaluation .\n",
      "Mr. No suffers from a bipolar mood disorder , together with hypercholesterolemia and vertebral basilar insufficiency .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "On physical examination , the patient was a well developed , stocky gentleman .\n",
      "The blood pressure was 115/80 , pulse 80 , respirations of 20 , venous pressure elevated at 3 cm above the clavicle at 90 degrees .\n",
      "There were very small , barely palpable carotid pulses .\n",
      "There was dullness at the right base , with a high diaphragm and possibly some fluid .\n",
      "The cardiac examination showed a left ventricular tap at the fifth intercostal space left of the midclavicular line .\n",
      "There was a grade II / VI systolic ejection murmur in the aortic area , no third sound , and paradoxical splitting of the second sound .\n",
      "The liver was not palpable .\n",
      "There were diminished pulses in the legs .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "The hemoglobin was 14.4 grams percent , white blood count 6,900 , platelet count 125,000 , sodium 137 mEq. per liter , potassium of 4.7 , BUN and creatinine of 23 and 1.3 mg percent .\n",
      "The electrocardiogram showed left ventricular hypertrophy and non-specific ST-T wave changes .\n",
      "The chest film showed massive cardiomegaly with pulmonary venous engorgement .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "I indicated to Dr. Brown that I had never seen a situation in which an adult had stenosed aortic valve so rapidly , but certainly his clinical signs suggested aortic stenosis .\n",
      "Accordingly , on April 2 , 1993 , he underwent a cardiac catheterization .\n",
      "The study showed that the right internal mammary and left internal mammary artery grafts were patent to the distal vessels .\n",
      "The right saphenous vein graft was also patent , but there was a high grade narrowing in the vessel beyond it .\n",
      "Using transeptal catheterization , he proved to have a 70 mm gradient across the aortic valve and there was no doubt about his aortic stenosis .\n",
      "The left ventricular contraction showed an ejection fraction of around 25% .\n",
      "An attempt at transesophageal echocardiogram was unsuccessful , because the patient was not cooperative .\n",
      "On April 8 , 1993 , Dr. G Hemp performed open heart surgery .\n",
      "At the time of operation , the porcine valve showed a heavy fibrous pannus underneath the valve , and there was what looked like organized thrombus in the leaflets which impeded leaflet movement .\n",
      "There was no calcification of the valve , and no clear evidence of infection .\n",
      "I have in fact never seen anything quite like this on an aortic porcine valve .\n",
      "The valve was replaced , and a saphenous vein graft was then constructed from the distal saphenous vein graft that was already in place to the distal right coronary artery beyond the obstruction .\n",
      "The surgery was very difficult , because of a great deal of scarring from the previous operation , but generally things went along smoothly .\n",
      "Mr. No was on the pump for 2 hours and 25 minutes , with an aortic crossclamp time of 1 hour and 48 minutes .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient was extubated on the first postoperative day .\n",
      "He had a good deal of pulmonary congestion .\n",
      "He seemed to be doing well until the morning of 4-13-93 when he suddenly became pulseless .\n",
      "There was no evidence of ventricular fibrillation .\n",
      "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation was immediately undertaken , but was not successful .\n",
      "The patient had his chest opened for any evidence of tamponade and there was no evidence of bleeding .\n",
      "The heart appeared to be flaccid .\n",
      "We really have no good explanation of what this was all about .\n",
      "He was being treated for a possible pneumonia .\n",
      "He did have a good deal of pulmonary congestion , but this occurred suddenly and unexpectedly .\n",
      "Cardiopulmonary resuscitation efforts were carried out for virtually one hour , but were unsuccessful .\n",
      "The patient was pronounced dead on the morning of 4-13-93 .\n",
      "A post mortem examination will be performed .\n",

      "The patient seemed to settle down while in the hospital and in fact started to have solid bowel movements and so on a controlled diet , which was purposely free of milk and milk products , the patient was discharged to be followed by his doctor , Dr. Both at the Sonpathcermu Jords Hospital but suffice it to say that no pathology was found in this hospital .\n",
      "He had widespread abdominal distention and for a while looked like he might have had ischemic problems with his sigmoid colon resulting in a functional large bowel obstruction but this cleared while he was in the hospital and he expelled large amounts of gas and decompressed his distention and his diarrhea stopped and he seemed to be much , much better .\n",
      "Whether this was related to medication , viral gastroenteritis or ischemic bowel problems is unclear , but he got better and went home .\n",

As you know, her course was complicated by heparin induced thrombocytopenia, and she has been continued on Coumadin anticoagulation.  She has done relatively well in five weeks since surgery and her energy level has improved.  The major ongoing symptoms is aching in the upper part of the sternum, and an opening in the lower part of the incision which drains some purulent material.  She also has a suture and her leg which has worked its way to the surface and causes some discomfort.  Her breathing is much better than preoperatively, and she has had no chest pain.  She has very mild residual dyspnea.  She has had mild edema at times, but it has largely resolved.  She has had no fever.\n",

After the patient's informed consent was obtained, the area was prepared in the usual sterile fashion, and 1% lidocaine along with 0.2 cc of Depo-Medrol was injected in the area of the flexor POLLICIS longus tendon sheath.  The patient tolerated the procedure well.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "5.  Right shoulder pain.  The patient cannot take nonsteroidals due to her renal problem, so I have given her a prescription for Tylenol with Codeine, of which she may take one or one-half tablet as needed to control the pain.\n",

      "Her abdominal exam revealed a diffusely tender abdomen which was greater in the lower quadrant without guarding , but with early peritoneal signs .\n",
      "A KUB performed on the night of admission showed no free air and no small bowel obstruction or ileus .\n",
      "An abdominal CT scan with oral contrast did not show any evidence for fluid collection or abscess .\n",
      "However , there was diffuse thickening of the small bowel up to the terminal ileum , as well as some thickening of the rectum .\n",
      "This was not in a clear vascular distribution and there was no air evident in the wall of the small or large bowel .\n",
      "These findings were felt to be consistent with radiation enteritis .\n",

      "ASSOCIATED DIAGNOSIS :\n",
      "Atrial fibrillation , coronary artery disease , hypertension , dementia , and diabetes .\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "The patient is a 72 year old white male who was transferred from Cay Memorial Hospital Of for cardiac catheterization and Electrophysiology Studies .\n",
      "His cardiac risk factors include :\n",
      "hypercholesterolemia , hypertension and insulin dependent diabetes mellitus .\n",
      "He has a history of chest pain and in January 1993 underwent a cardiac catheterization at Ph University Of Medical Center which revealed an occluded right coronary artery with distal filling via left to right collaterals , a large left anterior descending with a 40-50% proximal stenosis and a co-dominant left circumflex with mild disease .\n",
      "He subsequently had an echocardiogram in December 1994 which showed normal left ventricular size and systolic function .\n",
      "He subsequently had an adenosine sestamibi in February 1997 which was negative for ischemia or infarction .\n",
      "In December 1994 he had a paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia presenting with palpitations .\n",
      "He was diagnosed with Wolfe Parkinson White Syndrome .\n",
      "He underwent an electrophysiology study which identified an accessory pathway with multiple attempts at ablation by Dr. Slusslashgodle which were unsuccessful .\n",
      "He was treated with Sotalol for the supraventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "On 9/2/98 he was admitted to Cay Memorial Hospital Of with palpitations and was found to have an irregular wide complex tachycardia thought to be due to atrial fibrillation and conduction down his accessory pathway .\n",
      "He had mild congestive heart failure and was treated with an increased dose of Lasix .\n",
      "An echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of approximately 50% and mild to moderate mitral regurgitation .\n",
      "He was discharged home but returned on 9/13/98 with worsening palpitations on and off .\n",
      "He was again found to be in a wide complex tachycardia and was treated with magnesium .\n",
      "He denied any associated chest pain or dyspnea and he ruled out for a myocardial infarction .\n",
      "He continued to have intermittent runs of the wide complex tachycardia and was therefore transferred to Ph University Of Medical Center for further evaluation and management .\n",
      "Prior to transfer he did have one episode of chest pain during the night without electrocardiogram changes .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "Hypertension , hypercholesterolemia , diabetes mellitus , depression , prostate cancer status post surgery .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "Sotalol 160 mg bid .\n",
      "Atenolol 25 mg bid .\n",
      "Prilosec 20 mg qd .\n",
      "Propulsid 10 mg qd .\n",
      "NPH and CZI insulin .\n",
      "Resulin 400 mg qd .\n",
      "Lisinopril 10 mg bid .\n",
      "Aspirin .\n",
      "Lasix 60 mg qd .\n",
      "ALLERGIES :\n",
      "He reports an allergy to both codeine and iodine .\n",
      "There was also a question of an allergy to Prednisone which he said causes eye swelling .\n",
      "However , the details of this are quite uncertain and it is not clear if this was a true allergy .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAM :\n",
      "He was comfortable with a blood pressure of 156/78 , pulse 56 and respirations of 16 .\n",
      "His lungs were clear throughout .\n",
      "His apical impulse was nondisplaced with a regular rate and rhythm , normal S1 and S2 but not S3 or S4 .\n",
      "There was a grade 1/6 holosystolic murmur at the lower left sternal border radiating to the apex .\n",
      "Carotid pulses were 2+ bilaterally and there was no jugular venous distention .\n",
      "His abdomen was benign .\n",
      "Femoral pulses were 2+ bilaterally without bruits and he had pedal edema bilaterally .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "BUN 18 , creatinine 1.8 , magnesium 1.5 , cholesterol 154 with an HDL 41 , LDL 100 .\n",
      "His creatinine phosphokinase was 42 .\n",
      "His hematocrit was 49.3 .\n",
      "His electrocardiogram showed sinus bradycardia with a delta wave and an intraventricular conduction delay consistent with Wolf Parkinson White Syndrome .\n",
      "There were also nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "The patient clearly was suffering from atrial arrhythmias conducting down his bypass tract which were difficult to manage and causing symptomatic palpitations .\n",
      "Given his known coronary artery disease and his recent heart failure and chest pain a cardiac catheterization was indicated prior to proceeding to an electrophysiology study .\n",
      "His initial cardiac catheterization had to be postponed given the possibility of an allergy to Prednisone .\n",
      "He was seen by Nnoatal Hospital Center who felt that he could be safely treated with Solumedrol rather than Prednisone together with Benadryl and the use of low ionic contrast medium .\n",
      "Accordingly the patient underwent uneventful cardiac catheterization on 9/17/98 which revealed a pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 25 and a left ventricular end diastolic pressure of 20 .\n",
      "His right coronary artery was occluded and filled distally via left to right collaterals .\n",
      "He had a 50% proximal left anterior descending stenosis and only minor disease to the left circumflex .\n",
      "His left ventriculogram showed preserved systolic function and mild mitral regurgitation .\n",
      "The patient then underwent an electrophysiology study on 9/20/98 .\n",
      "There was no inducible supraventricular tachycardia but he did have evidence of a left lateral bypass tract .\n",
      "Mapping of the mitral anulus confirmed the location of the bypass tract .\n",
      "Radiofrequency ablation was applied there and resulted in the elimination of the preoperatively-excitation .\n",
      "There were no complications .\n",
      "Following the procedure there was no further evidence of wide complex tachycardia .\n",
      "He still did have occasional short runs of atrial tachycardia but there were no associated palpitations .\n",
      "In following up his ablation he underwent a Holter monitor which showed normal sinus rhythm at rates of 40 to 80 .\n",
      "There were 15 atrial runs the longest of which was 13 beats at a rate of 100 .\n",
      "He also underwent a post-procedural echocardiogram which showed an ejection fraction of 61% with mild mitral regurgitation and left atrial enlargement at 45mm .\n",
      "Following the procedure his QT interval was noted to be prolonged to approximately .55 seconds .\n",
      "His Sotalol was therefore decreased to 120 mg bid and his QT and QTC intervals decreased to .45-.48 seconds .\n",
      "After the procedure he was started on Heparin and loaded on Coumadin for a period of the next 3-4 weeks following radiofrequency ablation .\n",
      "His INR was 2.3 prior to discharge and he was scheduled to follow-up with the Anticoagulation Clinic to follow his Coumadin dose .\n",
      "Finally , his dementia appeared to worsen following receiving medications for agitation during his EP study .\n",
      "Accordingly he was seen by Neurology who felt that there was no evidence of a secondary process .\n",
      "He did have a head CT which showed no evidence of a bleed or stroke .\n",
      "Finally , his blood pressure had trended up during his hospitalization particularly with the decreased dose of Sotalol .\n",
      "Given his occasional sinus bradycardia his Atenolol was not advanced but instead his Zestril dose was increased from 10-20 mg bid and his blood pressure responded appropriately .\n",
      "CONDITION ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "He was discharged in stable condition on 9/23/98 .\n",
      "He will have a visiting nurse to see him on Iat .\n",
      "FOLLOW-UP :\n",
      "He will follow-up with Dr. Taarnna Service at Ph University Of Medical Center as well as Dr. Lupevickette Folk and Dr. Dwainco Rallsversgach on Villean Garl .\n",

      "The patient was admitted to the floor with variable changes in his EKG .\n",
      "He became pain free in the Emergency Room and was initially admitted to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\n",
      "However , he developed recurrent chest discomfort on the floor with worsening of his anterior ST segments with elevation , and he was taken to the cardiac catheterization laboratory .\n",
      "In the cardiac catheterization laboratory , right heart catheterization showed RA 7 , RV 36/9 , wedge 16 .\n",
      "He was treated with Integrelin in addition to his intravenous heparin , aspirin , and nitrates .\n",
      "He was found to have the left anterior descending occluded proximally with right to left collaterals .\n",
      "The circumflex was codominant with severe 90% lesion proximally in the circumflex and 50% lesion in a large OM .\n",
      "The right coronary artery was codominant and had an ostial stenosis in the 70% range .\n",
      "Left ventriculography revealed an akinetic anterolateral wall .\n",
      "A balloon pump was placed and right heart catheterization was performed showing the above .\n",
      "The patient developed worsening ST elevation on the monitor and the decision was made to go ahead and open the left anterior descending .\n",
      "The procedure was reasonably complicated in that the left anterior descending had poor re-flow and two stents needed to be placed , as there was a second lesion in the mid left anterior descending .\n",
      "The distal vessel was quite diseased and poor with regard to vessel quality and caliber .\n",
      "A good result was obtained with a stent in the proximal left anterior descending and a stent in the mid left anterior descending and the patient went to the Intensive Care Unit on a balloon pump , intubated .\n",
      "His peak CPK was in the 3000 range .\n",
      "The patient developed hemoptysis while intubated and on Integrelin and heparin .\n",
      "He underwent bronchoscopy , which showed no specific lesion .\n",
      "In addition , chest CT showed no obvious reason for his hemoptysis , with the exception of atelectasis .\n",
      "It was felt that perhaps the patient had atelectasis and perhaps some aspiration , which predisposed him to hemoptysis .\n",
      "In addition , the patient had confusion and delirium .\n",
      "Head CT was without any obvious intracranial catastrophe .\n",
      "He was seen in consultation by the Neurology and Psychiatry services and felt to have cognitive deficits and was ultimately controlled and managed with a combination of Seroquel and Haldol .\n",
      "In addition , the patient had a sitter during parts of his hospital course to keep him oriented .\n",
      "The patient had a return to the cardiac catheterization lab on 2/2/02 to receive a stent to the tight circumflex .\n",
      "This was uneventful , without the need for intubation , etc , and the procedure went smoothly .\n",
      "He tolerated it well .\n",
      "The ostial right coronary was a relatively small vessel for the patient and was not approached this admission .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to Evinlandcalco Hospital .\n",
      "He had difficulties with urinary incontinence and required straight catheterization for post-void residuals up until the time of this dictation .\n",
      "He was still having 300 cc or so post-void remaining in his bladder .\n",
      "He is followed by Dr. Squithsherl in this regard .\n",
      "At the time of this dictation , the plan is for probable transfer to a rehabilitation facility for physical therapy .\n",
      "He has had no recurrent heart angina pectoris or heart failure .\n",
      "Of note , cardiac echocardiogram revealed an ejection fraction in the 40% range with apical akinesis .\n",

Upon review of her medications, she is on a very good medication control, and  her blood pressure has been well controlled.  However, today the blood pressure is running higher.  I will see her in about two to three months.  If her blood pressure continues to be high, we should try to increase her dose of ARB.

      "HISTORY:  Mr. Ehlers is referred for evaluation of extensive coronary disease status.  He has history of several risk factors and a history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and a history of cigarette smoking. He has a prior history of peripheral arterial disease with a known abdominal aortic aneurysm.  He also has a history of bicuspid aortic valve with mild-to-moderate stenosis on recent echos and paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  \n",
      "\n",
      "He is status post a posterolateral MI in 2084 and had an adenosine MIBI in January 2097 with an old inferior MI and peri-infarct ischemia.  He presented with increasing angina with exertion where he is able to do most activities and climb stairs and walk his dog, but does have about one episode of angina a week while raking leaves that last about 5 minutes and resolves with rest.  He has not had any rest pain.  For his increasing angina, he had an attempted cardiac catheterization done last month, but they are unable to advance the guidewire pass the iliac artery and an MRI was able to determine that he has an occluded aorta.  He then had a left brachial artery.  Cardiac catheterization that revealed extensive coronary disease with a 70-80% distal left main stenosis and severe disease of the LAD and circumflex with minimal flow and a subtotal occlusion of the proximal right coronary with collateralization from the LAD territory.  There was an anomalous circumflex that appeared to emerge from the right coronary and there was a question of his anomalus LAD with a separate ostium superior to the left main, but the documentation of this was not clear.  With the complexity of his anatomy, he is referred for further evaluation.  He has otherwise a history of cigarette smoking and quit three months ago, does not drink alcohol.  He is married and lives in Missouri.\n",
      "\n",
      "MEDICATIONS:  His baseline medicines include aspirin 81 mg a day, has included warfarin, ramipril 10 mg a day, Lopressor 50 mg twice a day, Lipitor 80 mg a day and Zetia 10 mg a day.\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  A well-appearing man in no acute distress.  Blood pressure of 128/60, pulse of 60-70 and room air sat of 99%.  He had no jugular venous distention.  Chest was clear.  Heart had normal S1 and S2.  No S3 or S4.  There is a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur along the left sternal border.  His abdomen was benign.  Extremities showed no peripheral edema, but very faint distal pulses that were audible by Doppler.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMAGING STUDIES:  His electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with left anterior fascicular block and was otherwise unremarkable.  His labs showed a BUN/creatinine of 21/1.3, glucose 145 and hematocrit of 40%.\n",
      "\n",
      "IMPRESSION:  Mr. Ehlers presents with extensive vascular disease including left main and three-vessel disease.  We will try and define better his actual anatomy and likely do act angiogram to try and identify the locations of any anomalus vessels and then have a surgical consults regarding bypass surgery for his left main extensive disease.  We will also get an echocardiogram to reevaluate carefully the aortic valve.  We will also likely consult the vascular surgeons to discuss management of the occluded aorta.\n",

      "have her totally occluded right coronary artery bypass.  Therefore,\n",
      "I suggest that this reversible ischemia in the inferior wall is\n",
      "probably old and was the result of the fact that they did not\n",

      "wouldn't be unreasonable to refer her to ENT to have them evaluate\n",
      "her ears as a possible source of her pounding headaches.  In the\n",

      "nitroglycerin in the event that her blood pressure shoots up during\n",
      "these episodes.  I suspect that her blood pressure rise during\n",

      "Her oxygen saturations improved to only 92% on 100% face mask and she was admitted to Pre Health Intensive Care Unit .\n",
      "Chest x-ray there revealed bilateral pulmonary infiltrates with increasing pleural effusion .\n",
      "A VQ scan was high probability , but no pulmonary angiogram was done and an echocardiogram revealed a normal left ventricle with no wall motion abnormality and an ejection fraction of 75% .\n",
      "On May 24 , 1998 , the patient had a CT scan of the chest which revealed diffuse alveolar infiltrates at the right base , mediastinal lymphadenopathy and bilateral pleural effusions .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "1 ) Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia :\n",
      "The video assisted thoracoscopic study at the outside hospital was consistent with bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia .\n",
      "The patient was continued on steroids throughout the course of her stay .\n",
      "This was changed to Solu-Medrol part way through the course due to her hematologic problems , see below .\n",
      "By discharge , she was returned to 40 mg of Prednisone q. day times one month to be followed by a slow taper .\n",
      "The patient 's bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia appeared to improve slowly throughout her hospital course , however on July 12 , 1998 , after starting dialysis ( see below ) , the patient desaturated and required supplemental oxygen .\n",
      "Repeat chest x-rays and chest CT scans appeared consistent with pulmonary edema from volume overload given her renal failure and eventually , the patient 's pulmonary status did improve after significant volume removal with dialysis for several weeks .\n",
      "At the time of her discharge , the patient was still requiring two liters of supplemental oxygen to maintain her oxygen saturations in the mid 90% .\n",
      "2 ) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura :\n",
      "The patient was initially admitted with platelet count of 28 , hematocrit of 32 , LDH of 496 with 2+ schistocytes and 2+ spherocytes on her smear .\n",

      "She was also changed to intravenous Solu-Medrol 50 mg q. day which was changed back to 40 mg of Prednisone prior to discharge .\n",
      "Her platelet count initially rose to a maximum of 159 on July 3 , 1998 , then they steadily fell to a low of 60 on July 20 , 1999 .\n",
      "Her LDH which peaked at 1255 decreased to the mid 200s , but remained elevated .\n",
      "She continued to have a few schistocytes on her smear , but it was much decreased .\n",
      "The patient also required red blood cell transfusions , approximately two units every seven to ten days to maintain her hematocrit .\n",
      "Eventually , her plasma exchange was tapered to a smaller and smaller dose each day and then discontinued altogether after July 27 , 1999 .\n",
      "After this , the patient 's platelet count rose to a maximum of 177 on discharge .\n",
      "It is felt that the patient 's thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura has resolved .\n",
      "She will continue on her Prednisone for one month as above for the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia with a very slow taper .\n",
      "3 ) Renal :\n",
      "The patient presented in acute renal failure with a BUN of 101 and a creatinine of 3.7 .\n",
      "Throughout the month of June , she had a rising Potassium phosphate and increasing volume overload with decreasing response to diuretics and she was finally initiated on dialysis with ultrafiltration on July 12 , 1998 .\n",
      "The opinion of the Renal consult was that this was permanent and non-reversible renal failure since it did not improve with dialysis and the patient will continue on dialysis three times per week .\n",
      "She required approximately five liters of ultrafiltration fluid removal at each dialysis session due to her significant volume overload .\n",
      "During the course of her dialysis , she had a great improvement in her lower extremity edema and her oxygen saturation .\n",
      "4 ) Infectious disease :\n",
      "The patient had multiple line infections during her admission including a confirmed coag. negative Staphylococcus line infection with positive blood cultures on June 23 , 1998 , July 4 , 1998 , July 8 , 1998 and July 9 , 1998 .\n",

      "5 ) Rheumatology :\n",
      "The patient was admitted with a question of lupus given her ANA of 1:640 although her rheumatoid factor and ANCA were negative .\n",
      "Unfortunately throughout her admission , we were unable to test any more titers since she was receiving daily plasma exchange .\n",
      "A repeat ANA , rheumatoid factor and ANCA may be repeated as an outpatient .\n",

      "The admission chest X-ray showed bilateral apical calcific densities that were felt to be consistent with granulomas .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted and underwent abdominal ultrasound , which was more consistent with a cystic lesion .\n",
      "She also had a magnetic resonance imaging study , which suggested cyst or hemangioma .\n",
      "However , a computerized tomography scan suggested a solid mass .\n",
      "Given the uncertainty , decision was made to proceed with angiography and exploration to resolve the issue .\n",
      "A mesenteric angiogram on 11-27-92 demonstrated no variant anatomy , the venous phase being okay , and no other abnormalities .\n",
      "On 11-28-92 , the patient was brought to the Operating Room where she underwent exploratory laparotomy , total mobilization of the liver with intraoperative ultrasound , resection of fat necrosis of the small bowel mesentery and extensive lysis of adhesions .\n",
      "Dr. Besti Kotebreun of the Radiology Service performed intraoperative ultrasound , and carefully looked at the entire liver .\n",
      "The mass that had been seen on computerized tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging study proved to be a simple cyst and the rest of the liver looked perfectly normal .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure well and postoperatively had a relatively uneventful course .\n",
      "She was advanced slowly to a regular diet .\n",
      "She did have some persistent fever after the operation with a white blood count in the 14-15,000 range and on the day of discharge , her temperature was in the 101 range .\n",
      "She said that she routinely runs fevers to 101 or 102 at home and has for years , and insisted upon going home .\n",
      "This seemed reasonable given there was no identifiable source for a fever at the time of discharge and she promised close follow up for any problems .\n",
      "It should be noted that her CEA upon admission was 13.9 , indicating that she must have tumor somewhere .\n",
      "She underwent a computerized tomography scan of the chest prior to discharge , which demonstrated no evidence of pulmonary metastases .\n",
      "She also underwent a bone scan by Nuclear Radiology , which demonstrated no findings suggestive of metastatic disease .\n",

If the disease was, indeed, progressing, we would need to proceed with lung transplantation workup.  The most significant contraindication currently to transplantation is his substantial obesity.  I calculated with him that he needed to have his weight down to 190 lbs. to get to a BMI of 30, and that by the time of listing he needed to have a BMI of approximately 32.

      "The patient is a 31 year old gravida-2 para-0 with a known twin gestation with an estimated date of confinement of 02/27/98 .\n",
      "On the day of admission , the patient had an ultrasound which showed the infants to be in the breech /vertex presentation .\n",
      "Also noted on ultrasound was a shortened cervix at 1.8 centimeters and funneling of the lower uterine segment .\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the triage area of labor and delivery and noted to be having contractions every two minutes .\n",
      "She was given one dose of terbutaline with a subsequent tachycardia to 120 .\n",
      "She was then started on magnesium sulfate with a 4 gram bolus followed by two grams per hour .\n",
      "This seemed to decrease the frequency of her contractions significantly and she was only having a rare contraction .\n",
      "Her cervix on admission was closed and about 80 percent effaced .\n",
      "She was given betamethasone and transferred to the antenatal unit .\n",
      "She did well for the first two days with only minor complaints of irregular contractions .\n",
      "On the morning of 12/24/98 she seemed to be having more contractions and pelvic exam revealed the cervix to be one centimeter , 80 percent effaced .\n",
      "Consultation was obtained with Dr. Lou who suggested at least briefly increasing the infusion rate to see if her pregnancy could be prolonged longer .\n",
      "She seemed to respond to this with only irregular contractions .\n",
      "On the evening of 12/24/98 , the patient once again complained of increasing contraction frequency as well as back pain .\n",
      "Examination revealed the cervix to now be 2-3 centimeters dilated and the decision was made to discontinue the magnesium and to perform delivery .\n",
      "She had a primary Cesarean section because of the breech presentation and on Christmas she underwent uncomplicated primary Monroe Kerr Cesarean section under spinal anesthesia .\n",
      "At 2:10 a.m. on 12/25/98 the patient was delivered of a 3 pound 5 ounce male infant with Apgars of 7 at one and 8 at five minutes .\n",

      "She did well postoperatively with minimal discomfort .\n",
      "On the morning of discharge , the patient complained of a warm swollen area on the posterior aspect of her left knee .\n",
      "Consultation was obtained with the cardiovascular group and the decision was that she had superficial phlebitis of her left leg which could be treated conservatively and would not require Heparin .\n",

      "ABDOMEN :\n",
      "Soft , slightly distended , nontender .\n",
      "No hernias .\n",
      "The patient did have right costovertebral angle tenderness , decreased bowel sounds .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted after placement of a nasogastric tube and was brought emergently to the operating room after a CT scan done in the emergency room revealed marked dilatation of the afferent loop and duodenum .\n",
      "There was significant dilatation from the duodenal stump to the proximal jejunum and an abrupt transition point prior to the likely anastomosis .\n",
      "There was no evidence of perforation on the CT scan .\n",
      "The patient went to the operating room on the evening of 03/13/00 and after extensive lysis of adhesions , the Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunum to jejunum was examined and there was found to be a slightly proximal adhesion compressing the afferent limb .\n",
      "This was taken down and the Roux-en-Y anastomosis was re-sited proximally .\n",
      "There was no other obvious finding on the initial exploratory laparotomy and the peritoneal fluid that was encountered appeared just ascitic in nature .\n",
      "Postoperatively , the patient was tachycardic and had low urine output which initially was responsive to intravenous boluses of Crystalloid .\n",
      "However by the mid morning of the 14th of March , the patient had ceased making urine and had become profoundly tachycardic .\n",
      "The patient was invasively lined with a Swan Ganz catheter and arterial line and was transferred to the intensive care unit .\n",
      "At this point the patient 's creatinine was noted to have esculated to 2.1 and his white blood cell count was close to 4 on admission had plummeted to 0.43 .\n",
      "The patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics for the prospect of sepsis given his neutropenia and previous splenectomy and then an echocardiogram was performed to assess left ventricular function .\n",
      "The transesophageal echocardiogram revealed essentially normal left ventricular function but was a very limited exam .\n",
      "The Swan Ganz catheter numbers confirmed that the patient had suboptimal cardiac output and was developing a septic like picture .\n",
      "On 03/14/00 the patient returned to the operating room for exploratory laparotomy after pressors and antibiotics did not reverse his septic course .\n",
      "Upon exploring the abdomen , the adhesions were fully lysed on the right side of the abdomen and bile staining was noted in the retroperitoneum .\n",
      "However prior to this it was also noted that the patient 's scrotum was necrotic .\n",
      "An incision was made into the scrotum and bilious staining was encountered .\n",
      "Therefore the patient underwent a scrotal debridement and bilateral orchiectomy as well as debridement of the right spermatic cord , debridement of the peritoneum over the bladder which additionally had bilious staining .\n",
      "In the abdomen the patient 's retroperitoneum was fully debrided and the source of the bilious staining was traced back to the junction of the second and third portion of the duodenum which was found to have a 2.5x2.5 centimeter perforation which all appeared walled-off .\n",
      "The anastomosis appeared intact on examination .\n",
      "Upon return to the intensive care unit following this procedure , the patient still had a septic-like picture and was maintained on Neo-Synephrine .\n",
      "He was hydrated vigorously .\n",
      "It should be noted that in addition to the afore mentioned duodenal perforation , the patient also was noted to have a pancreatitis by enzymes .\n",
      "This was thought to be related to the back pressure in the afferent limb and this resolve over the course of his immediate postoperative days .\n",
      "The patient 's urine output was marginal and the sepsis appeared not to be well controlled .\n",
      "therefore the patient went back to the operating room on 03/15/00 for another exploratory laparotomy .\n",
      "Further debridement was undertaken .\n",
      "The patient was washed out and an ileocecectomy for necrotic appearing bowel was performed .\n",
      "The patient went back to the operating room however his septic course was not reversed .\n",
      "On 03/16/00 the patient had a completion colectomy and partial proctatectomy in the bed in the intensive care unit as a last ditch attempt to gain the upper hand on the septic physiology .\n",
      "Unfortunately , this did not reverse his septic course and despite maximal pressor management and fluid resuscitation , the patient remained hypotensive .\n",
      "The patient 's family was confronted with the bleak nature of his prognosis and elected to withdraw support on the evening of 03/16/00 .\n",
      "The patient expired at 12:30 a.m. on the morning of 03/17/00 .\n",

      "UA was negative with sediment , 4 to 5 white cells , 1 to 2 red cells , and 1+ bacteria .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "By systems -\n",
      "1) GI - The patient was admitted to the floor and underwent extraction of the piece of chicken from his esophagus later that afternoon .\n",
      "Extraction was successful and foreign body was removed piecemeal .\n",
      "EGD was performed .\n",
      "Subsequently at the site where the chicken was stuck there was no notable trauma or lesion distal to the chicken .\n",
      "There was some gastritis and duodenitis but no frank ulcers .\n",
      "The patient was sent to the floor and GI wise was doing well until approximately 9/22/93 when he developed an ileus one day status post teeth extraction and general anesthesia .\n",
      "The patient also had a GI bleed at that time and an NG tube was placed with removal of 2500 cc of dark brown bilious guaiac positive fluid .\n",
      "The patient was stabilized with fluid and improved quickly from this status over the weekend and Hct has been stable since that time .\n",
      "Other GI issues include the patient 's hypopharyngeal cancer which will be discussed below .\n",
      "2) Oncology - The patient was diagnosed prior to this admission with hypopharyngeal cancer for which he was going to undergo external radiation therapy for .\n",
      "Because of the multiple complications and lack of nutrition and inability of the patient to swallow without aspirating it was felt that this should be delayed until he is under better nutritional status .\n",
      "3) Feeding and nutrition - The patient was unable to eat any food or drink by mouth given that he demonstrated frank aspiration each time he attempted this including with soft solids and puree foods .\n",
      "A swallowing study was performed which clearly demonstrated frank aspiration and poor swallowing mechanism by the patient .\n",
      "Several NG tubes were placed and the patient kept pulling the NG tubes out because his mental status was not completely cleared .\n",
      "The patient was sustained on IV fluids with D10 and multivitamins , thiamine , and folate .\n",
      "He was kept NPO given his history of aspiration and further attempts were made to fee the patient and finally as the patient 's mental status cleared he was responsive to having an NG feeding tube placed with Jevity feeds started .\n",
      "Other options were considered including a PEG placement as well as surgical placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it was felt that less aggressive measures with an NG tube would be prudent at this juncture given the patient 's poor prognosis for the future .\n",
      "The family was involved in making decisions regarding the patient 's nutritional status and originally felt that IV fluids alone should be used , however , finally decided that some sort of feeding should be undertaken and the NG tube was the initial thought .\n",
      "It is felt that if the NG tube does not work out the patient may need to be reassessed for potential placement of a gastrostomy tube , however , it is felt by all parties involved that the aggressive end may also present significant risk to this patient given that an operative procedure may be dangerous and patient has shown significant desaturation and uncooperativeness with his first EGD on admission .\n",
      "4) Pulmonary - The patient had a clear chest x-ray other than a right lower lobe opacity consistent with scarring vs. fat pad which has been chronic on admission .\n",
      "The patient was saturating well throughout the initial part of the stay until he had the upper GI bleed on 9/22/93 at which time he also had significant aspiration of vomitus and was considered to have a probable aspiration pneumonia but with vague findings on chest x-ray .\n",
      "The chest x-ray cleared rather rapidly and on the third day post aspiration was consistent with the original admission x-ray .\n",
      "However , after aspiration given that the patient had a white count bump from under 10,000 to 16,000 it was felt that he should be started on antibiotics and he was started on Ceftriaxone and clindamycin for a total 10 day course for presumptive aspiration pneumonia .\n",
      "The patient was afebrile throughout this period and tolerated antibiotics well and pneumonia appeared to resolve .\n",
      "No organism was ever cultured out of the sputum .\n",
      "5) GU - The patient was not entirely responsive to using urinal or the bathroom and at times was incontinent .\n",
      "It was thought that a Foley catheter would be most appropriate and he seemed to tolerate this well .\n",
      "He had at one point the possibility of UTI but he was asymptomatic and on rechecking the urine there was no sign of urinary tract infection .\n",
      "The patient continued to be asymptomatic .\n",
      "6) Neurological - The patient originally was almost completely non-responsive at least to verbal command but as his hospital course progressed he became somewhat more alert and towards the end of his hospital course was much more alert and oriented usually only times two and was difficult .\n",
      "The patient was much more cooperative towards the end of his stay and much more appropriate , however , he did not seem to fully comprehend the fact that he had cancer and that he would not be able to swallow things by mouth .\n",
      "These issues were explained to him repeatedly , however , he did not appear to comprehend them from day to day .\n",
      "Psychiatry evaluated the patient and felt that he was not competent to decide his own affairs .\n",
      "7) Social issues - The wife had obtained health proxy prior to this admission and it was felt that since the patient was not competent to make decisions on his own the wife would make decisions regarding the health status and treatment of the patient .\n",
      "It was decided the patient 's code status would not be DNR , DNI .\n",
      "8) Dental - The patient was noted to have very few teeth and it was noted that none appeared viable and it was felt that since he would be undergoing XRT in the future that his teeth should be removed to avoid radiation necrosis in the future when he received his XRT .\n",
      "He underwent extraction of all his teeth on 9/21/93 tolerating the procedure well initially but then developed the ileus as noted above and subsequently a GI bleed .\n",
      "Laboratory data on discharge revealed SMA 7 with sodium 134 , potassium 4.4 , chloride 103 , CO2 24 , BUN 5 , and creatinine 0.9 which has been stable at 0.9 to 1.0 with glucose 96 .\n",
      "CBC revealed Hct 30.7 which has been ranging from high of 29 to 31 over the last week .\n",
      "The white count was 7.5 , platelets 196 .\n",
      "The last PT and PTT on 09/26/93 were 13.4 and 27.3 with INR of 1.2 .\n",
      "The last UA and sedimentation revealed rare white blood cells but was otherwise negative and the culture revealed no growth on 09/27/93 .\n",
      "The patient had a chest x-ray which showed a few right upper lobe and one left upper lobe nodule and a follow-up chest x-ray on 09/27/93 showed resolution of these previous nodular shadows .\n",
      "A faint nodule remained in the left upper lobe and it was felt that this is probably not any metastatic disease and not of concern , however , it was suggested that follow-up chest x-ray may be taken to insure that these densities resolve .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "The patient is a 65 year old Portuguese male with a history of an anterior myocardial infarction i May 1993 and is status post a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty of the LAD who presented on 10-24-93 with crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\n",
      "He had no prior cardiac history until May 1993 when on 5-24 he had crushing chest pain which radiated to his left arm .\n",
      "He was found at that time to have 3-4 mm ST segment elevations in V1 through V4 at Pre Health .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital and had 4-7 mm ST segment elevations across the precordium with Q's in V1 and V2 , 2 mm ST elevation in AVL , and 1-2 mm reciprocal ST depression in II , III , and F.\n",
      "On physical examination at that time he had bright red blood per rectum and therefore lysis was deferred and he was taken directly to the cardiac catheterization lab .\n",
      "The cardiac catheterization results at that time revealed a right atrial pressure of 7 , pulmonary artery pressure of 29/16 , RV 33/8 , pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 16 .\n",
      "He had a 95% proximal left anterior descending lesion which was PTCA 'd to a residual of 30% and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\n",
      "He also had some mild to moderate disease at the OM1 noted at that time .\n",
      "The patient was transferred to the Cardiac Care Unit where he had a peak CPK of 5,042 and 26.7% MB's .\n",
      "His intra-aortic balloon pump was weaned without problems .\n",
      "He had hypotension with beta blockers and therefore they were not started .\n",
      "On day six , an echocardiogram showed an ejection fraction of 44% with anterior akinesis and septal hypokinesis .\n",
      "On day nine , he had a low level exercise tolerance test with Thallium which was positive for 2.5 mm horizontal depressions in II , III , and AVF , and 1.5 mm downsloping ST depressions in V5 and V6 , as well as some anteroseptal redistribution on Thallium .\n",
      "Therefore , he went to repeat cardiac catheterization which revealed that the left anterior descending site was patent and revealed a distal PDA lesion and a circumflex lesion after the OM .\n",
      "The patient was discharged to home and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Shuffburle of Gastroenterology for work up of his bright red blood per rectum and is supposed to follow up with Dr. Amesin of Cardiology and Dr. Shuffpasc of Dingclearf Alllirefaith Memorial Hospital .\n",
      "However , he did not keep any of these appointments .\n",
      "He went home and did not take any of his medications and smoked and drank heavily throughout the several months .\n",
      "On the a.m. of 10-24-93 , the patient developed crushing substernal chest pain and shortness of breath .\n",
      "He came to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital Emergency Ward where he was noted to be ashen and diaphoretic .\n",
      "He was treated with oxygen , aspirin , five sublingual nitroglycerins , heparin , and was eventually made pain free with that regimen .\n",
      "CARDIAC RISK FACTORS :\n",
      "His cardiac risk factors included hypertension , diabetes mellitus , hypercholesterolemia , cigarette smoking , and a positive family history .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",

      "PAST SURGICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "His past surgical history had included gastric ulcer surgery and appendectomy .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "On admission , he was on Isordil 10 tid and enteric coated aspirin , but he was not taking either of these medications .\n",
      "HABITS :\n",
      "The patient smokes one pack per day and has a history of heavy alcohol use .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "The physical examination on admission revealed a blood pressure of 110/70 , a heart rate of 66 , respirations of 24 , temperature of 98 .\n",
      "The HEENT exam revealed the extra ocular movements intact .\n",
      "The pupils equal , round , reactive to light .\n",
      "The oropharynx was clear and the fundi were normal .\n",
      "There were no hypertensive or diabetic changes .\n",
      "The neck was suppled , with no lymphadenopathy and no jugular venous distention .\n",
      "The carotids were 1+ without bruits .\n",
      "The heart was regular rate and rhythm , S4 , S1 , S2 , with a I / VI systolic murmur at the left lower sternal border .\n",
      "The lungs were clear , except for a few dry crackles bibasilarly .\n",
      "The abdomen revealed a midline scar and a right lower quadrant scar , and it was soft and nontender wit positive bowel sounds .\n",
      "The liver edge was 2 cm below the right costal margin , but smooth and nontender .\n",
      "There was no splenomegaly .\n",
      "The femoral pulses were diminished .\n",
      "He had bilateral intertrigo in his femoral region as well as his axillae .\n",

      "The pulses were 1+ bilaterally .\n",
      "The skin exam revealed changes consistent with vitiligo .\n",
      "The rectal examination was guaiac negative .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "The laboratory data revealed normal electrolytes , BUN and creatinine , normal liver function tests , a first CPK of 140 , and a hematocrit of 43.1 .\n",
      "The portable chest X-ray showed clear lungs , slight enlarged heart , and a mildly elevated hemidiaphragm .\n",
      "The electrocardiogram was normal sinus rhythm at 81 , with normal intervals and normal axis , had poor R-wave progression consistent with an old anterior myocardial infarction , had flipped T-waves in V1 through V5 , which were of no significant change since his last EKG on 5-25-93 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Step Down Unit for a rule out MI protocol .\n",
      "He was treated with aspirin , heparin , and intravenous nitroglycerin .\n",
      "No beta blockers was started because of his history of hypertension with beta blockers and because his blood pressure of only 110/70 .\n",
      "The patient ruled in for myocardial infarction with a peak CPK of 219 and 20.9% MB fraction .\n",
      "This was a non-Q wave myocardial infarction as there were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes .\n",
      "on 10-27-93 , the patient went to the cath lab which revealed a small nondominant right coronary artery without any lesions , a restenosis of the proximal left anterior descending lesion that had been PTCA 'd , a lesion in the first OM , and a moderately severe left circumflex lesion after the OM3 .\n",
      "The left ventriculogram revealed an akinetic anterolateral and apical ventricle .\n",
      "Given the results of this cardiac catheterization , which were not significantly changed from his previous cardiac catheterization prior to the PTCA , it was elected to attempt to medically manage the patient .\n",
      "He was ambulated progressively on the floor .\n",
      "A beta blocker was started with Metoprolol initially at 25 mg PO bid and eventually increased to 50 mg PO bid .\n",
      "The patient ambulated extensively on the FIH 20 floor each day without any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath .\n",
      "On 11-2-93 , the patient underwent a low level treadmill exercise test with Thallium imaging .\n",
      "This treadmill test was done on medications , including beta blockers , in hopes to assess an amount of ischemia on treatment .\n",
      "The patient was able to exercise for approximately nine minutes on a modified Bruce protocol , however , he did not reach his predicted maximal heart rate while he was on the beta blockade .\n",
      "There were no diagnostic electrocardiogram changes during the treadmill exercise test , although he did have 0.5 to 1 mm ST depression in II , III , and AVF .\n",
      "The study was halted for shortness of breath and there was no chest pain .\n",
      "Thallium images revealed a moderate sized region of ischemic but viable myocardium involving the anteroseptal and lateral segments of the left ventricle .\n",
      "There was also some evidence of left ventricular dysfunction during the test .\n",
      "These images were essentially unchanged compared with the previous Thallium images in May 1993 .\n",
      "After extensive discussion between myself , Dr. Amesin , and Dr. Scgach , it was elected to discharge the patient to home with medical management .\n",
      "The patient was extremely reluctant to undergo surgery , although he understands that this may become necessary in the future .\n",
      "Dr. Amesin had a long discussion with the patient 's daughters revolving primarily around issues of the patient 's compliance .\n",
      "Previously he had not taken any of his medicines and smoked heavily on the outside and not kept any of his appointments .\n",
      "The importance of quitting smoking as well as continuing to follow his medical regimen was emphasized to the daughter and to the patient .\n",
      "She will be actively involved in encouraging the patient to comply with this medical regimen and also to follow up with Dr. Amesin as well as Dr. Lfsquarc on the outside .\n",
      "The patient remained guaiac negative throughout the entire hospitalization .\n",
      "Despite being on heparin for a short time , his hematocrit remained very stable with only a small dip after the catheterization was done .\n",
      "He will need to be followed up as an out patient for guaiac positive stools and possibly worked up for this in the future .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "This is a 56-year-old man with a history of ischemic disease transferred to the FIH for further care for cardiogenic shock .\n",
      "Mr. Given had an anterior myocardial infarction in 1981 .\n",
      "He had inferior myocardial infarction in February 1992 .\n",
      "His course was complicated at that time by hypertension and an echocardiogram showed an LV ejection fraction of 0.10 to 0.15 .\n",
      "In August , 1993 he had an out of hospital cardiac arrest .\n",
      "He rule in for another myocardial infarction at that time .\n",
      "He was transferred to the FIH where he underwent a work up of both his arrhythmia and his heart failure .\n",
      "An automatic implantable defibrillator was placed .\n",
      "He was thought to be a good candidate for a transplant at that time as coronary arteriography showed diffuse disease in the LAD and right coronary arteries as well as a proximal circumflex stenosis .\n",
      "Because of the diffuse nature of the disease and the left ventricular dysfunction , Mr. Given was thought not to be a revascularization candidate and was listed for a transplant .\n",
      "Mr. Given waited as an outpatient for the availability of a donor heart .\n",
      "He was admitted to the hospital in late April with multiple episodes of bloody diarrhea .\n",
      "Colonoscopy demonstrated severe Crohn 's disease with sparing of the rectum .\n",
      "A perirectal fistula was seen .\n",
      "Treatment with IV corticosteroids led to improvement and Mr. Given was discharged from the hospital ten days ago .\n",
      "On the evening of April 22nd , Mr. Given developed progressively worsening dyspnea .\n",
      "He presented to the Iming Medical Center emergency room on the morning of April 22nd with hypertension and dyspnea .\n",
      "He was given intravenous fluid to support his blood pressure and developed pulmonary edema and was intubated .\n",
      "Hypertension continued and an intra-aortic balloon pump was placed .\n",
      "He is now being transferred to the FIH for further treatment .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "Physical examination on transfer was remarkable for a blood pressure of 80/56 and a heart rate of 124 .\n",
      "His CVP was 16 .\n",
      "He was on the balloon pump at the time .\n",
      "His chest was clear anteriorly .\n",
      "His cardiac exam was remarkable for a summation gallop .\n",
      "No murmur was auscultated but the high heart rate did diminish the possibility of this .\n",
      "His abdomen was soft and he had no extremity edema .\n",
      "His feet were cool but there were pedal pulses bilaterally .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "Admission laboratory studies included a hematocrit of 34.3 and a white count of 25,700 .\n",
      "The sodium was 126 , the BUN 80 and a creatinine of 4.6 .\n",
      "Electrocardiogram revealed a sinus tachycardia with an intraventricular conduction defect .\n",
      "There were inferior Q waves consistent with an old infarct .\n",
      "The chest x-ray revealed mild pulmonary edema and cardiomegaly .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Mr. Given was admitted to the hospital and it was hoped that his end organ dysfunction would improve with a period of ballooning and improved perfusion such as to allow transplantation to eventually take place .\n",
      "He was maintained on Levophed as a vasopressor as well as dopamine and dobutamine .\n",
      "It was noted that his intra-aortic balloon pump was only a 30 ml pump , and on the day after admission , Mr. Given was taken to the catheterization laboratory where this was exchanged for a 40 ml pump .\n",
      "After replacement of the intra-aortic balloon pump , Mr. Given remained critically ill , although there was some improvement in his augmented diastolic pressure .\n",
      "He did develop atrial fibrillation , however , which led to hemodynamic decompensation with a wedge pressure of 32 and a cardiac index of 1.6 .\n",
      "It was hoped that with continued inotropic support this would improve .\n",
      "He also remained intubated .\n",
      "Mr. Given was seen by Dr. Farstshuff of the GI Service for advice regarding his Crohn 's disease .\n",
      "All of these issues , including his acute renal failure , were thought to be contraindications to transplantation .\n",
      "As Mr. Given did not have any bowel sounds , he did have to remain on nasogastric suction .\n",
      "He was seen in consultation by Dr. Needs of the Renal Unit .\n",
      "Dr. Needs felt that the patient had had ischemic acute tubular necrosis and that we could continue to administer diuretics in a an effort to take off volume , but that we did have to allow time to pass in order to see improvement .\n",
      "Procainamide was begun in an effort to convert Mr. Given to sinus rhythm from atrial fibrillation .\n",
      "Initially he was in and out of sinus rhythm , but paroxysmal atrial fibrillation did occur frequently .\n",
      "As Mr. Given 's renal function did not improve , he was begun on continuous venovenous hemodialysis .\n",
      "This resulted in a reasonable clearance of creatinine .\n",
      "He was able to get some fluid off as well .\n",
      "With getting some volume off , the patient 's ventilation improved , as did many of his other metabolic parameters .\n",
      "His cardiac index had also improved with this to 2.7 , although he was on dobutamine as well .\n",
      "On 6/19 an effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump .\n",
      "With a decrease in the counterpulsation ration , he developed atrial flutter with a fall in blood pressure and cardiac index .\n",
      "The balloon pump was restored .\n",
      "He was continued on this as well as on dobutamine and amrinone support .\n",
      "He continued on hemodialysis , but had little urine output .\n",
      "Supportive care continued .\n",
      "Unfortunately , the white blood count began rising , raising the possibility of sepsis .\n",
      "Broad spectrum antibiotics to cover potential sources in the gastrointestinal tract were begun and ciprofloxacin was added .\n",
      "Mr. Given 's blood pressure appeared to stabilize .\n",
      "Another effort was made on 6/22 to attempt to wean the balloon , but this led to an increase in his wedge pressure and a fall in his arterial pressure , and this was stopped and he was restored to full counterpulsation .\n",
      "He had been able to be transiently extubated after dialysis had reduced his lung water , but he had to be reintubated on 6/24 .\n",
      "Hemodialysis continued with maintenance of reasonable metabolic parameters .\n",
      "He did develop worsening metabolic acidosis .\n",
      "His hemodialysis was adjusted in an effort to resolve this .\n",
      "He continued on vancomycin , ciprofloxacin , Zosyn , and fluconazole antibiotics .\n",
      "Another effort was made to attempt to wean the intra-aortic balloon pump on 6/26 .\n",
      "This resulted in a fall in his cardiac index , but his blood pressure and wedge pressure were stable .\n",
      "He did have runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "On 6/29 Mr. Given began developing periods of hypotension .\n",
      "The patient stated that he did not want to be reintubated , as it became quite clear that he would not be a transplant candidate .\n",
      "He began having multiple runs of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia .\n",
      "The patient and his significant friend , Incloztaua , had a long discussion with his physicians and they felt that , given the futility of his situation , supportive care should be ended .\n",
      "Indicative of this , Mr. Given took his oxygen mask and demanded that it not be replaced .\n",
      "He developed progressive hypotension and was pronounced dead early on the morning of 7/1 .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Ms. Shuffa is a 73-year-old Portuguese speaking woman who was transferred via Med Flight to Verg Medical Center .\n",
      "She arrived intubated and was hemodynamically stable despite concerns of a dissecting aortic arch aneurysm .\n",
      "She initially presented to Brottlake Medical Center on 9/15/00 complaining of acute onset dysphasia to liquids and solids .\n",
      "While she was in Brottlake Medical Center , she developed new onset stridor , and an ENT consult was obtained .\n",
      "They attempted a fiberoptic intubation with a # 6 endotracheal tube and found a 5 mm severely compressed airway .\n",
      "She was also found to have a differential systolic blood pressure and ecchymosis on her anterior chest .\n",
      "Given these findings , she underwent a CT scan which showed a retrotracheal mass that appeared to obliterate the esophagus .\n",
      "This raised concerns for a hemorrhage , and she was transferred to Verg Medical Center emergently .\n",
      "At the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center , she underwent an emergent CT scan with IV contrast .\n",
      "This revealed no extravasation of contrast and no aortic aneurysm .\n",
      "However , it did show an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with a density consistent with a hematoma .\n",
      "She was admitted to the Thoracic Surgery Service under the care of Dr. Sccrookes .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",

      "PULSE :\n",
      "On the right side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial ; on the left side , 2+ femoral , popliteal , DP , PT , and radial .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "CBC was 8.7 , 25.3 , and 184 .\n",

      "Electrolytes were 143 , 3.4 , 105 , 28 , 24 , 3 , and 131 .\n",
      "EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with left ventricular hypertrophy and incomplete left bundle branch block .\n",
      "CT scan showed an anterior mediastinal mass compressing the trachea with air .\n",
      "It was consistent with a hematoma .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Ms. Shuffa underwent an EGD and flexible bronchoscopy on 9/16/00 shortly after she arrived .\n",
      "This showed tracheal compressions but no other lesions that were obvious at the time .\n",
      "She was hemodynamically stable and remained on the ventilator .\n",
      "The differential diagnoses at this point consisted of hematoma vs. neoplasm vs. an abscess vs. a thyroid tumor .\n",
      "On 9/22/00 , she underwent a cervical mediastinoscopy .\n",
      "A biopsy of this mass was consistent with hematoma .\n",
      "The operative report shows that there was an abnormal area below the trachea to the left which represented a cavity between the esophagus , trachea , aorta , and spine that was full of clot .\n",
      "There was no active bleeding at the time .\n",
      "Over the next several days , the patient remained hemodynamically stable on the ventilator .\n",
      "She had an elevated calcium level that raised the suspicion that this mass could be a hematoma coming from a ruptured parathyroid adenoma .\n",
      "The ionized calcium was elevated as was the parathormone level .\n",
      "Given these findings , she underwent a Sestamibi scan .\n",
      "The Sestamibi scan showed findings that were consistent with a parathyroid adenoma in the right lobe of the thyroid .\n",
      "At this time , it was believed that her clot was due to a rupture of this parathyroid adenoma .\n",
      "Dr. Ear brought the patient to the operating room on 10/5/00 .\n",
      "She underwent a parathyroid exploration with resection of a ruptured ectopic right upper parathyroid adenoma , a biopsy of a normal left and right lower parathyroids , resection of a left upper parathyroid , and tracheostomy .\n",
      "She tolerated the procedure well and was transferred back to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit with her new tracheostomy working well .\n",
      "Her postoperative course was complicated by serosanguineous pleural effusion on the left .\n",
      "This required a chest tube .\n",
      "Her hematocrit continued to drop over the next couple of days despite normal platelet count , normal coags , and no obvious source of bleeding .\n",
      "It was believed that she was continuing to bleed in her chest .\n",
      "However , we are not quite sure why this was occurring .\n",
      "She underwent an extensive workup by Hematology that revealed a bleeding diatheses of unknown etiology .\n",
      "It turns out that several people in her family have a similar bleeding diathesis of unknown etiology .\n",
      "In conclusion , by systems :\n",
      "1. Neuro .\n",
      "The patient became intermittently agitated .\n",
      "We have been giving her Haldol at bedtime as well as Ativan p.r.n. throughout the day .\n",
      "She responds well to this .\n",
      "She speaks some English and seems to understand more than she speaks .\n",
      "She has a family member who is present for approximately 12 hours each day .\n",
      "She has been very helpful in translating and seems to say that Ms. Shuffa is in good spirits .\n",
      "2. Cardiac .\n",
      "The patient 's blood pressure has been ranging from approximately 140 to 160 systolic .\n",
      "This is on a current regimen of Lopressor 25 mg per NG tube t.i.d. as well as Diltiazem 60 mg per NG tube t.i.d. , and lisinopril 10 mg per NG tube q.d. She occasionally gets hypertensive when she is agitated .\n",
      "For this , we have given her 10 mg of hydralazine .\n",
      "Her blood pressure responds well to this .\n",
      "Otherwise , she is in normal sinus rhythm and has been hemodynamically stable throughout her hospitalization .\n",
      "The patient developed a left femoral artery pseudoaneurysm after placement of a Greenfield filter .\n",
      "This has been followed by the Vascular Surgery Service here at the Ingree and Ot of Weamanshy Medical Center .\n",
      "Dr. Lenni Lung has been consulted .\n",
      "The aneurysm at the time of discharge is approximately 2.5 cm .\n",
      "They elected not to inject it with thrombin .\n",
      "They asked that the patient follow-up with Dr. Ear in approximately three to four weeks so that this aneurysm can be assessed .\n",
      "They have opted for conservative management given the size .\n",
      "3. Respiratory .\n",
      "At the time of discharge , the patient remained on CPAP with a PEEP of 7.5 and a pressure support of 9 .\n",
      "She seems to be tolerating this well as she has an O2 sat of 100% on 40% FIO2 .\n",
      "Her chest x-ray shows a left lower lobe hematoma that had greatly improved in the last few days .\n",
      "Her right lung field is clear .\n",
      "Her tracheostomy is functioning well , and we have had no problems with it .\n",
      "She will obviously need to be weaned as tolerated .\n",
      "We had her down to a low pressure support of 7 in the last week .\n",
      "With the pressure support at 7 , she became tachypneic and had to be brought back up to 10 .\n",
      "Her oxygen saturation has always been good .\n",
      "4. GI .\n",
      "The patient is getting tube feeds via her NG tube of full strength Jevity of 75 cc per hour .\n",
      "This is her goal .\n",
      "She tolerates them very well and has approximately 200 cc to 300 cc of stool per day .\n",
      "Last week , she had copious amounts of stool in the range of 500 cc to 1000 cc of liquid stool per day .\n",
      "Stool cultures have been sent numerous times as well as analysis for C. difficile toxin .\n",
      "These have all been negative .\n",
      "We believe the this was an osmotic diarrhea .\n",
      "Since her tube feeds have been changed from full strength Nephro to Jevity , her diarrhea has resolved .\n",
      "She has been taking Zantac , and the pH of her NG tube residuals have been in the 5 to 8 range .\n",
      "5. GU .\n",
      "The patient has had hypernatremia .\n",
      "She is approximately 10 kg up her overall body weight .\n",
      "We believe her to still be total body overloaded .\n",
      "Over the last several days , we have been giving her approximately 500 cc to 1000 cc of free water through her NG tube .\n",
      "We also have been diuresing her with Bumex .\n",
      "This seems to trend her sodium down .\n",
      "This will need to be monitored closely .\n",
      "Her BUN and creatinine have been normal , and she has always made good urine .\n",
      "6. Heme .\n",
      "As stated before , the patient continued to ooze into her pleural space well after her definitive operation .\n",
      "She had an extensive workup by Hematology which revealed a bleeding diathesis of unknown origin .\n",
      "Before we removed her chest tube , we had to give her platelets .\n",
      "She had no problems with this .\n",
      "At the time of discharge , her hematocrit is stable in the 28 to 33 range .\n",
      "I stress that she cannot be anticoagulated .\n",
      "We have given her Lovenox in the past , and she continues to bleed .\n",
      "Therefore , she is on no DVT prophylaxis .\n",
      "She does have a left iliac deep vein thrombosis .\n",
      "She has a Greenfield filter in place , and this is her only DVT prophylaxis .\n",
      "7. ID .\n",
      "At the time of discharge , the patient has a urinary tract infection .\n",
      "She is growing Enterobacter cloacae that is sensitive only to Macrodantin from her urine cultures .\n",
      "Interestingly enough , she also has Enterobacter cloacae growing out of her sputum .\n",
      "This is also sensitive only to Macrodantin .\n",
      "We do not believe that she has any respiratory process going on at the time .\n",
      "She is just begun on Macrodantin at the day of discharge and should continue 100 mg per NG tube q.i.d. for a ten day course .\n",
      "Her Foley was changed the day before discharge .\n",
      "8. Tubes , lines , and drains .\n",
      "The patient has a tracheostomy , NG tube , and a Foley catheter .\n",

      "Lasix 40 mg qd ; Digoxin 0.25 mg qd ; aspirin 325 mg qd ; Isordil 10 mg tid .\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Mr. Breun underwent a six vessel coronary artery bypass grafting procedure in March , 1990 , following a complicated inferior posterior myocardial infarction .\n",
      "He had a very stormy course , dominated by post infarction angina pectoris , high grade atrial ventricular block , gastrointestinal bleeding , pneumonia , and no noliguric renal failure .\n",
      "An intra-aortic balloon pump was required for stabilization .\n",
      "He also had moderately severe aortic stenosis at that time with a peak aortic valve gradient of 30 , and a calculated valve area of 1.2 cm squared .\n",
      "Despite the magnitude of these problems , he made a remarkable recovery over the course of several months , and was able to return to work on a part-time basis , after joining a program of cardiac rehabilitation .\n",
      "Postoperatively , we measured a left ventricle ejection fraction of 40% , by gated cardiac blood pool scanning .\n",
      "Over these past 3 years , he has remained stable , on a very simple program of aspirin , and Atenolol .\n",
      "He returned for routine office evaluation on 3/25/93 , complaining of 2 months of progressive exertional dyspnea , with occasional chest discomfort , and , more recently , orthopnea , cough , peripheral edema , and weight gain .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "Weight 197 lbs , up 6 lbs , blood pressure 128/88 , heart rate 70 and regular .\n",
      "The venous pressure was markedly elevated to 15 cm .\n",
      "The carotids were of low volume , and sluggish bilaterally , with transmission of a basal heart murmur .\n",
      "There was dullness at both bases , with rales 1/3 way upon the right , and at the base on the left .\n",
      "The right ventricle , and left ventricle impulses were diffuse .\n",
      "There was a Grade I-II murmur of aortic stenosis , with additional murmurs of tricuspid , and mitral regurgitation , and an obvious S3 .\n",
      "The liver was enlarged 2 finger breadths below the right costal margin , and there was 1-2+ peripheral edema .\n",
      "His chest X-ray demonstrated cardiomegaly , with bilateral pleural effusions , right greater than left , and pulmonary vascular re-distribution .\n",
      "The electrocardiogram showed a normal sinus rhythm with first degree AV block , an old inferior myocardial infarction , and old anteroseptal myocardial infarction , and non-specific ST-T wave abnormalities , that were unchanged compared to June , 1992 .\n",
      "Later , an echocardiogram on 3/27/93 , demonstrated mild mitral regurgitation with calcification of the annulus , and incomplete closure of the valve , consistent with papillary muscle dysfunction .\n",
      "The left atrium was dilated to 52 mm .\n",
      "The aortic valve was thickened , with restrictive motion , and there were indistinct mobile echo densities on the leaflets .\n",
      "There was evidence of trace aortic regurgitation , however , due to technical difficulties , accurate gradients could not be estimated .\n",
      "The left ventricle was dilated , with concentric hypertrophy , and multi segmental wall motion abnormalities , with a reduced ejection fraction of 24% .\n",
      "There was also Doppler evidence of tricuspid regurgitation and pulmonary insufficiency .\n",
      "A Persantine Thallium scan on 3/31/93 , showed increased lung uptake , cavity dilatation and a large inferior , apical scar , without evidence of active ischemia .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "potassium 4.4 , BUN and creatinine 33/1.7 , albumen 3.6 , total bilirubin 1.8 , direct bilirubin 0.5 , CK 162 , with 11.1 MB for a relative index of 6.9% .\n",
      "This was of uncertain significance .\n",
      "The hematocrit 43.2 , whiteblood count 9.2 , prothrombin time 10.4 , partial thromboplastin time 34.2 , urinalysis had 1+ albumen and 0-2 white blood cells , per high power field , with a culture that demonstrated rare Enterococcus .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Medical Service , and placed at bed rest , and given intravenous Furosemide .\n",
      "Over the course of the next few days , we succeeded in having his weight decrease from its value of 189 lbs , to as low as 177 1/2 lbs .\n",
      "Coincident with this , his clinical condition improved markedly , and he became fully ambulatory .\n",
      "Given the difficulties in trying to assess the exact mechanism by which his heart failure had occurred , we proceeded to cardiac catheterization on 4/1/93 .\n",
      "At the time of this study , the right atrial pressure was 1 , the PA pressure 32/10 , and the mean pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was 10 .\n",
      "There was a 40-50 mm peak to peak gradient across the aortic valve , a mean gradient of 40 , and a calculated valve area of 0.5 cm squared , using a cardiac output of 3.4 liters per minute .\n",
      "Left ventriculography demonstrated marked left ventricle dilatation .\n",
      "There was mild mitral regurgitation , a posterior basil aneurysm , and akinesis of the apex , septum , and inferior walls .\n",
      "The anterior lateral wall was severely hypokinetic , and the posterior lateral wall moderately kinetic .\n",
      "The aortic valve was calcified with reduced excursion consistent with his aortic stenosis .\n",
      "A dominant right coronary artery had an 80% proximal stenosis , and was then occluded at the acute margin .\n",
      "A large right ventricular marginal branch did fill the saphenous vein graft in a retrograde fashion .\n",
      "The posterior descending artery had an 80% stenosis proximal to the insertion of the graft .\n",
      "The left anterior descending was proximally occluded , and the left circumflex had a 90% stenosis in the first marginal branch , and 90% stenosis distally in other branches .\n",
      "The saphenous vein graft to the right ventricular acute marginal and posterior descending artery was patent with good runoff .\n",
      "The saphenous vein graft to the left anterior descending had a minor plaque at the distal anastomosis .\n",
      "The saphenous vein graft to three distal marginal branches was patent with good flow .\n",
      "Certainly , the cardiac catheterization was consistent with severe aortic stenosis in the presence of profound left ventricular systolic dysfunction .\n",
      "These findings were reviewed with Dr. Patella and together we decided that conservative therapy would be the appropriate first choice in Mr. Breun 's management .\n",
      "His advanced age , prior cardiac surgery and advanced left ventricular dysfunction , together with his chronic renal insufficiency , would certainly complicate to an enormous degree any undertaking as risky as redo surgery for aortic valve replacement .\n",
      "Percutaneous aortic valvuloplasty , on the other hand , would only be a temporary procedure and did not seem necessary even for transient symptomatic relief given his marked improvement following a rather conventional course of intravenous diuretics .\n",
      "It is very unlikely that we will offer Mr. Breun aortic valve replacement surgery in the future .\n",
      "He seems to agree with this particular approach as the quality of life has become very important and appropriate issue for him .\n",
      "He is looking forward to returning home and going back to work on a part time basis at the local pharmacy .\n",
      "We will see how far we can get with medical therapy although Mr. Wierst and his family clearly understand the long term implications of his aortic stenosis .\n",

      "Your patient Lauren Ferrara came into the office today for a follow-up visit.  As you know, she has a long and complex history of peripheral vascular disease with bilateral lower extremity bypass grafts.  Her left lower extremity bypass graft had occluded once previously, but was successfully restored by Dr. Tejeda.  In 02/61, we had detected a high-grade stenosis in the distal aspect of this graft by surveillance, and she underwent revision with a local patch angioplasty.  A subsequent ultrasound study done in 04/61 showed a widely patent graft and she has remained entirely asymptomatic.  She is not particularly active.  She denies any rest pain in the feet or significant claudication symptoms.  Recently, however, her husband had noticed some cyanosis of her left toes.  She remains on low dose aspirin in addition to Lipitor and her other medications.  She is a nonsmoker.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "On examination today, she appeared well and in good spirits.  Blood pressure was measured at 130/60 in the right arm.  Lower extremity pulses are 2+ at the femoral level bilaterally.  On the right, there is a strong, easily appreciated pulse over her popliteal to dorsalis pedis bypass graft, and the foot is warm and well perfused.  On the left, I could not appreciate a pulse over her bypass graft incisions.  The left foot is slightly cooler than the right, and there are some mild cyanotic changes on the first toe in particular.  There are no frank or impending ulcerations or areas of irreversible ischemia.  There is a strong Doppler signal obtained over the posterior tibial artery at the ankle with an occlusion pressure of approximately 100 mmHg.  This yields an ankle index of nearly 0.7 and maybe falsely elevated.  A follow-up ultrasound study was performed in the vascular laboratory today.  The right lower extremity bypass remains widely patent.  As suspected, the left lower extremity bypass has now demonstrated to be occluded.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms. Ferrara left lower extremity bypass graft has occluded sometime during the last several months and her collateralization is clearly more marginal.  At the present time, she does not have any clear-cut symptoms of critical limb ischemia, though the slight discoloration of her toes is a clear sign.  The previous history of this graft including a prior thrombosis requiring thrombectomy and multiple revisions would not board well for any attempted thrombolysis or repeated rescue of this particular conduit.  Conversely, she has already had all of her lower extremity veins used for bypass operations and any redo bypass would be technically complicated.  I will need to review her previous angiograms from earlier this year to determine the status of her runoff and what the alternatives might be.  At the present time, however, she appears to have marginal, though reasonable collateralization and is essentially asymptomatic.  I think it would be reasonable to increase her antithrombotic therapy and I added a daily dose of Plavix to supplement a baby aspirin.  I spent sometime discussing the signs of worsening ischemia including more diffuse cyanotic skin changes of the toes, rest pain, or ulceration.  At a minimum, I will see her back in two months for reexamination, but I strongly encouraged the patient and her husband to contact us soon if there are any symptoms that suggest worsening of her circulation.  If her collateralization can remain stable, it certainly would be preferable to avoid having to consider a complex redo bypass with very limited remaining vein in this patient.\n",

      "Her EKG was sinus at a rate of 114 with normal intervals , axis of -30 .\n",
      "She had Q waves in V1 and V2 with biphasic T waves in V2-V4 and also noted were a Q wave in V3 and no ST depressions were noted .\n",
      "There were slight ST elevation in V1-V2 suspicious for potential septal aneurysm .\n",
      "She also had subsequent EKGs which were remarkable for frequent premature ventricular complexes , however no ischemic changes were noted otherwise .\n",
      "When compared with her EKG of 4/24/96 she had lost her R wave in V2 .\n",
      "Her T wave which had been inverted on a prior EKG now were upright across the precordium .\n",
      "There was no change between her pain and pain free EKGs .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "Hospital course by system :\n",
      "1. CARDIAC :\n",
      "The patient was placed on a cardiac monitor and a rule out myocardial infarction protocol .\n",
      "She was placed on Nitropaste .\n",
      "She was given Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .\n",
      "She was up to 50 mg po bid for improved blood pressure and rate control .\n",
      "Her creatinine phosphokinases were cycled and she did subsequently rule out for a myocardial infarction with CKs of 114 , 115 and 106 with isoenzymes less than .4 , She was taken off her rule out protocol and underwent an echocardiogram on 7/31/96 which showed an EF of 35% .\n",
      "She had mild mitral regurgitation and dilated left atrium .\n",
      "A diffusely hypokinetic left ventricle with regional variations .\n",
      "There was focal wall thinning and increased reflectivity of the anterior and midseptum suggesting scar .\n",
      "The estimated ejection fraction as mentioned was 35% .\n",
      "The right ventricular size and systolic function were within normal limits .\n",
      "There was also noted upper septal hypertrophy without evidence of outflow obstruction .\n",
      "Given these echocardiographic findings she was begun an ACE inhibitor , Captopril , initially at 6.25 mg po tid .\n",
      "This was gradually advanced as her blood pressure would tolerate and her dose of transfer will be 25 mg po tid .\n",
      "She also underwent an adenosine MIBI stress test on 8/1/96 which showed nondiagnostic EKG response to stress however there was noted an area of hypoperfusion consistent with an anterior infarct and there was no active ischemia .\n",
      "She will be continued on an aspirin a day 325 mg po qd as well as Metoprolol 25 mg po bid .\n",
      "Given her recent start on an ACE inhibitor she will need to have her electrolytes , BUN and creatinine followed q 1 week x 4 weeks to be certain that her creatinine and potassium not dropping secondary to the ACE inhibitor .\n",
      "Given that she has had no clinical evidence of congestive heart failure she has not been placed on diuretics .\n",
      "However , she should be maintained on a low sodium diet and if she were to develop signs or symptoms of heart failure initiation of Lasix titrating to good urine output and adequate symptom control , could be necessary .\n",
      "She will not be transferred on Lasix however given that she has clinically been without any evidence of congestive heart failure .2 .\n",
      "NEUROLOGY :\n",
      "From a neurologic stand point the patient was initially quite agitated and unfamiliar with her surroundings .\n",
      "She was initially managed with prn Haldol as well as being maintained on her neurologic and psychiatric medicines including Depakote , Prozac , Klonopin and Trilafon .\n",
      "She gradually became less agitated and more cooperative .\n",
      "However , she does express frequent need for attention .\n",
      "She appears to be somewhat depressed , also intermittently confused and calling out for the nurse .\n",
      "In talking with her daughter and her sister it sounds as though these are baseline characteristics for this patient and she will continue on her current regimen .\n",
      "3. HYPERTENSION :\n",
      "From the hypertensive stand point she was initially maintained on Nifedipine as well as being started on the beta-block and ACE inhibitor as mentioned above .\n",
      "The Nifedipine was discontinued on 8/1/96 in order to allow for pushing ahead with her ACE inhibitor and beta-blocker as tolerated .\n",
      "Her blood pressure has been under control on these medications .4 .\n",
      "ORTHOPEDICS :\n",
      "She did have right knee pain and swelling .\n",
      "She underwent right knee plain film x-ray which showed an insignificant right knee effusion , osteoarthritic changes and no evidence of fracture .\n",
      "Her knee pain gradually improved and she was up and walking on the day prior to transfer .\n",
      "DISCHARGE INSTRUCTIONS :\n",
      "She will be followed by Dr. Nelson who follows her at the Montden Hospital .\n",
      "She will be transferred on 8/2/96 in good condition .\n",

      "1. AV conduction tissue disease .\n",
      "2. Coronary artery disease .\n",
      "PRINCIPAL PROCEDURE :\n",
      "Radiofrequency ablation of the slow pathway and permanent pacemaker implantation .\n",
      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Patient is an 82-year-old male with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease ( status-post PCI of the RCA one week ago ) , history of peripheral vascular disease and preserved LV function with history of nonsustained VT .\n",
      "He was transferred from an outside hospital for further investigation and management of his recent arrhythmic problem .\n",
      "He was noted by the cardiologist to complain of some malaise with no complaints of weakness and malaise .\n",
      "He also complained of mild palpitations and syncope .\n",
      "At the time of his visit to his cardiologist 's office , he was noted to be in tachycardia which was found to be a junctional tachycardia , treated with carotid sinus massage , breaking into sinus bradycardia .\n",
      "In the setting of the sinus bradycardia , he had a very prolonged PR interval and happened to be on sotalol which was subsequently discontinued .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\n",
      "Ecotrin ; Lipitor ; Cardura ; Plavix ; Lasix ; Cozaar ; Procardia .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "He was comfortable , afebrile with a heart rate of 60 beat / min and a blood pressure of 100/70 , respirations 18 .\n",
      "JVP was not raised .\n",
      "His cardiac exam revealed a fourth heart sounds , normal S1 , S2 and an ejection systolic murmur at the base of the heart .\n",
      "His abdominal examination was benign .\n",
      "Lungs were clear .\n",
      "His EKG at the time of presentation showed evidence of sinus bradycardia , prolonged PR interval at 100-500 ms and evidence of Wenckebach .\n",
      "His EKG also showed evidence of atrial echo beats and evidence of a slow AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia .\n",
      "IMPRESSION :\n",
      "Patient is an 82-year-old gentleman with a history of coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular disease with evidence of intrinsic conduction tissue disease who presented with an AVNRT .\n",
      "He was admitted with the idea of having electrophysiology study to determine the exact mechanism of his tachycardia and subsequently undergo radiofrequency ablation .\n",
      "It was also felt that because of his underlying conduction tissue disease , he would benefit from having a permanent pacemaker implanted .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient had his electrophysiology study on 12/23/2002 .\n",
      "His baseline tracings showed evidence of a high AV block with AV Wenckebach at 550 ms.\n",
      "He had evidence of AVNRT , typical slow-fast variant which was easily inducible .\n",
      "Two radiofrequency ablations at the slow pathway terminated the tachycardia .\n",
      "The patient was not inducible for tachycardia at the end of the procedure .\n",
      "The procedure was well tolerated , and he was transferred back to the step-down unit for further monitoring .\n",
      "On the next morning of 12/26/2002 , the patient had a dual chamber permanent pacemaker implanted .\n",
      "This was a Medtronic Sigma SDR 303 type pacemaker .\n",
      "His atrial and ventricular lead were both bipolar .\n",
      "The atrial measurements were as follows :\n",
      "amplitude 5.6 to 8 mV , outflow threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.4 ms , evidence for lead impedance of 450 ohm .\n",
      "His ventricular measurements were as follows :\n",
      "RV amplitude of greater than 15.68 , output threshold of 0.5 volts at 0.5 ms and impedance of 680 ohm .\n",
      "The patient was kept overnight for further monitoring .\n",
      "Noninvasive pacemaker evaluation on 12/26/2002 showed optimal sensing and capture thresholds of both the atrial and ventricular leads .\n",
      "A chest x-ray prior to discharge showed adequate position of the atrial and ventricular leads .\n",
      "Of note , there was a coincidental finding of a small solitary pulmonary nodule on his chest x-ray , and the patient has been advised regarding obtaining a CAT scan after discharge to follow up on this .\n",
      "After discussions with the patient and his family , they preferred having the CAT scan performed at the hospital closer to their residence so that it could be sequentially followed up with serial CAT scans if there was a need for the same .\n",
      "The patient will follow up with his cardiologist as well as his primary care physician in the outpatient setting .\n",
      "He has also been given a follow-up appointment with the pacemaker clinic .\n",
      "DISCHARGE MEDICATIONS :\n",
      "His medications at the time of discharge essentially remain the same .\n",
      "He is being discharged on :\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Mr. Breutzfarstxei is a 30 year old man with recently diagnosed acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia who presented with pneumonia , developed adult respiratory distress syndrome , and died in the hospital after failed efforts of ventilatory support .\n",
      "Mr. Breutzfarstxei was recently diagnosed with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome when he had Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia on 01/17/91 .\n",
      "He was admitted to the Retelk County Medical Center at that time and was treated with Bactrim and steroids .\n",
      "He was actually intubated and underwent bronchoscopy where the diagnosis was made with a positive toluidine blue study .\n",
      "He initially did well after extubation and completed approximately two weeks of Bactrim and a steroid taper .\n",
      "At discharge after about two weeks post-extubation , he had an O2 saturation of approximately 95% on room air .\n",
      "He was seen by Dr. Seen and Dr. Seen as an out-patient .\n",

      "Cultures were taken and he was sent out .\n",
      "On 02/08/91 , the patient called Dr. Seen because of increased shortness of breath and malaise .\n",
      "He was seen in FLFDMC where he was noted to have jaundice and newly palpable liver edge .\n",
      "Review of liver function tests revealed a cholestatic picture which was not previously found and it was felt that this was secondary to the Bactrim which had been recently stopped anyway .\n",
      "His oxygen saturation at that time was only 86% on room air and he was admitted .\n",
      "PAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\n",
      "1) HIV positive with a CD4 count of 74 .\n",

      "ALT was 181 , AST was 156 , LDH was 336 , alkaline phosphatase was 214 , and bilirubin was 12.7 total .\n",
      "( On 02/06 , his bilirubin had been 7.2 with 6 direct ) .\n",
      "His arterial blood gas on 50% was pO2 92 , pCO2 24 , and pH 7.46 .\n",
      "His chest X-Ray showed bilateral nodular infiltrates .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted for work-up of his cholestatic jaundice picture along with work-up for his pulmonary process and treatment of both .\n",
      "In terms of pulmonary function , it was felt that one possibility was that the patient was a Bactrim failure for PCP although this was unusual .\n",
      "He was started on Pentamidine , especially in light of the fact that it was felt that his liver function tests were due possibly to Bactrim .\n",
      "The patient was also covered with Erythromycin and Gentamicin for coverage of community acquired pneumonias and gram negative rods .\n",
      "He was given supplemental oxygen .\n",
      "In terms of his liver abnormalities , it was felt that viral hepatitis was in the differential as well as several opportunistic infections of the liver but also was felt that Bactrim could be a cause of these abnormalities .\n",
      "Titers for CMV and Epstein-Barr virus were sent and a titer for toxoplasma was sent .\n",
      "Stool was sent for ova and parasites .\n",
      "Gastrointestinal was consulted .\n",
      "Initially , the patient did well in terms of his pre-status and required less oxygen .\n",
      "However , on 02/10/91 , his respiratory rate increased and his oxygen saturation decreased .\n",
      "Actually in reviewing the records at this point , it appears that Pentamidine was not started initially so on the antibiotics of Erythromycin and Gentamicin , the patient 's respiratory status worsened and his LDH climbed so he began Pentamidine on 02/10/91 .\n",
      "On 02/11/91 , the patient again appeared more comfortable this time with 50% facemask but then required more oxygen , dropped his O2 saturations , and was intubated on 02/11/91 .\n",
      "He was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on 12/12/90 on Gentamicin , Vancomycin , Pentamidine , and Prednisone .\n",
      "Also of note at that point , hepatitis C virus serologies had come back positive .\n",
      "However , at this point , his liver function test abnormalities appeared more consistent with a cholestatic picture with his direct bilirubin being 12.1 and total being 14.1 .\n",
      "The patient 's abdominal CT scan showed no liver disease and no obstruction .\n",
      "The patient 's liver function tests appeared to improve .\n",
      "The patient 's penile ulcer was cultured and grew positive herpes simplex virus and the patient was started on Acyclovir .\n",
      "On 02/13/91 , the patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage performed which showed a toluidine blue with many pneumocysts noted .\n",
      "No other cultures grew out and the patient 's clinical status deteriorated .\n",
      "The patient required 100% oxygen to maintain adequate oxygen saturations on the ventilator .\n",
      "He required elevated ventilatory pressures with PIPS often above 60 .\n",
      "Fortunately , no evidence of baratroma was ever discerned .\n",
      "However , the patient 's respiratory status continued to decline and we were unable to maintain oxygen saturations above 80% even using reverse I to E ventilation , paralysis , sedation , and other modes of ventilation .\n",
      "Patient underwent liver biopsy on 02/16/91 and the results of this were pending when the patient died .\n",
      "The patient actually developed decreasing counts with white count as low as 1.75 , hematocrit as low as 26 , and platelets as low as 68 noted on 02/15/91 .\n",
      "These were supported with blood products and Hematology was consulted .\n",
      "They felt that it was most likely secondary to Bactrim and these actually were getting better when the patient died .\n",
      "Bone marrow biopsy was not attempted .\n",
      "Discussions were begun with the family regarding limits of supportive care .\n",
      "Due to continued worsening pulmonary status and an overall grim prognosis , the family decided , in consultation with the Medical Team , to withdraw ventilatory support .\n",
      "This was done on the evening of 02/18/91 .\n",
      "Patient expired after the endotracheal tube was withdrawn at 6:40 p.m.\n",
      "DISPOSITION :\n",
      "The patient died in hospital .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient was admitted to the Fairm of Ijordcompmac Hospital to the General Surgery Service of Dr. Lynea Moyduhe .\n",
      "A modified upper GI x-ray series was obtained , which revealed malpositioning of the duodenum and jejunum in the right abdomen , consistent with intestinal malrotation , but no evidence of obstruction in the duodenum or jejunum was identified .\n",
      "Therefore , the patient was prevented from taking anything by mouth and endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\n",
      "This study identified a 5 centimeter narrowed segment in the distal common bile duct , and moderately severe dilatation of the left biliary radicals in the right hepatic duct .\n",
      "A temporary stent was placed , which seemed to function well despite its unsatisfactory positioning .\n",
      "The patient tolerated the procedure well , and there were no complications .\n",
      "He was returned to the Surgical Ward in stable condition .\n",
      "Because of the probable malignant nature of the patient 's biliary obstruction , the patient was returned to the GI lab on 11/25/93 , where repeat endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography was performed .\n",
      "This procedure was performed under general anesthesia , and resulted in successful placement of a permanent stent within the distal common bile duct .\n",
      "Additionally , a computer tomography guided needle biopsy was performed of the paraportal mass .\n",
      "These procedures were well tolerated by the patient , and were free of complication .\n",
      "As before , the patient was covered with post-procedure antibiotic therapy .\n",
      "He was returned to the surgical ward in stable condition .\n",
      "Preliminary report on the biopsy specimen at the time of this dictation describes the presence of acute and chronic inflammation , but no malignant cells .\n",
      "However , two cytology specimens were both positive for malignant cells , the histopathologic characteristics of which suggest adenocarcinoma .\n",
      "Following the permanent stent placement , the patient 's diet was slowly advanced .\n",
      "His serum bilirubin levels and other liver function studies continued to normalize .\n",
      "Because of his rapid progress , the resolution of his right upper quadrant pain , and the fact that no surgical therapy was indicated at this time , the patient was discharged to his group home on 11/29/93 .\n",

      "Postoperatively , she developed ileus , then finally she recovered and she was discharged to the nursing home .\n",
      "She was readmitted because of a problem with uremia and high BUN and creatinine when she seen in the office and the BUN and creatinine was ordered .\n",
      "The BUN was 70 and creatinine was 4.6 and for this reason she had ultrasound of the kidney which showed bilateral hydronephrosis .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Ferrara returns for followup visit.  She is now approximately one month out from a redo left popliteal to peroneal artery bypass graft using a basilic vein from right arm.  Postoperatively, she did well, although she was very sensitive to pain medication in the hospital and it was difficult to get her moving.  She complains of persistent weakness and numbness in her right hand and some pain shooting into her right forearm.  According to the patient, this was present early during her hospitalization, but because of other issues, it was not paid very much attention.  She denies any significant pain in the leg.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  On examination today, she appears generally well.  The right arm harvest site is healed well and the upper arm is soft without any evidence of hematoma, whatsoever.  The hand is warm and well perfused with intact distal pulses; however, she clearly has weakness of flexion of the first and second digits and some weakness of opposition.  She appears to have intact ulnar and radial function.  The lower extremity incision has also healed well and there is a strong Doppler signal over the peroneal artery at the ankle.  The foot is warm and well perfused and the previous ischemic lesion on the big toe is healing.  She had a followup graft scan today, which revealed her bypass graft to be patent with no evidence of significant narrowing.  The ankle index was measured at 0.88 on the left and 0.64 on the right.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Ms. Ferrara lower extremity circulation is stable and her bypass graft is functioning nicely.  Unfortunately, she appears to have had some neuropathic complication in her right arm that may have been related to her vein harvest surgery.  The exam suggests some possible partial comprise of median nerve function.  In any case, she is able to function reasonably well and a course of occupational therapy may improve things.  There is no evidence of compression from hematoma and no evidence of infection.  We will continue to follow her closely with a return visit scheduled in six weeks and a course of therapy was prescribed.\n",

      "Her abdominal CT scan showed multiple lesions in the liver with enlarged periportal lymph nodes , cholelithiasis , and a left adrenal mass thought to likely represent metastatic disease .\n",
      "During her hospitalization , the main issues were pain control and nausea .\n",
      "Her pain was ultimately helped most by a regimen of oxycodone and oxycontin , and nausea responded to p.r.n. Trilafon .\n",
      "She was somewhat sedated on this regimen , and her standing Serax dose was reduced with substitution of Klonopin .\n",
      "She was seen by Radiation Medicine for palliative XRT to the painful lesions in her LS spine , and radiation therapy was begun on 10/2/97 with the plan for approximately 10 daily treatments .\n",
      "She required considerable encouragement to maintain PO intake , and required intravenous hydration to achieve adequate fluid intake during her hospitalization .\n",
      "A Physical Therapy evaluation could not be completed because of her degree of pain and nausea .\n",

      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "The patient received his bone marrow transplant on 06/12/00 .\n",
      "His course was then complicated by fevers and neutropenia which were treated with antibiotics and a diffuse erythroderm felt to be a drug reaction .\n",
      "On 06/24/00 the patient was found to have pulmonary infiltrates and some hemoptysis .\n",
      "A bronchoscopy was done and there was blood found in the upper airways but no evidence of blood in alveoli so it was not felt to be DAH .\n",
      "On 06/26/00 due to agitation , change in mental status and increased respiratory distress , the patient was intubated .\n",
      "It was felt at that time that the changing mental status and respiratory distress might be due to a combination of medication and worsening mucositis .\n",
      "Although the patient 's pain and sedation meds were adjusted he continued to be agitated and there was difficulty weaning him off the vent .\n",
      "Because of this continued agitation , a head CT was performed on 07/01/00 and it revealed an intraparenchymal hemorrhage .\n",
      "Neurosurgery was consulted but due to the severity of the bleed surgery was not considered an option .\n",

      "This is a 60-year-old Mandarin speaking gentleman , with a long history of end-stage liver disease secondary to Hepatitis B. infection diagnosed approximately six years prior to admission , who now presents with recurrence of right-sided hydrothorax thought to be related as an ascitic equivalent on the right side .\n",
      "The patient has been admitted multiple times with this symptom , and in this setting , was called in to the hospital by his primary care doctor on the day of admission for increasing shortness of breath , and dyspnea on exertion .\n",
      "He was admitted to the Medical Service where he was found to have a transudative , right-sided effusion thought again to be the equivalent of his ascites on the basis of end-stage liver disease .\n",
      "It was tapped and drained with placement of a chest tube .\n",
      "The chest tube was removed , but then replaced on the 14th of February , and maintained a continuous and large volume output .\n",
      "The patient was evaluated by the Liver Transplant Service , and on the end of his first week of admission , became increasingly somnolent with exam findings consistent with evolving hepatic encephalopathy .\n",
      "This change in mental status remained refractory to medical management , and in the setting of recurrent spiking fevers and worsening renal function , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit on the 17th of February , 1997 .\n",
      "In the Intensive Care Unit , his chest tube continued to have massive volume output , and an increasing number of white cells with a left shift were noted in the transudated fluid .\n",
      "He has not been considered as a candidate for a TIPPS or for pleurodesis , given his position at the top of the transplant list for his blood type , B .\n",
      "Early in his Intensive Care Unit admission , Mr. Hibbslires was intubated and ventilated , placed on broad antibiotic coverage including Vancomycin , Fluconazole , Ceftazidime , and Flagyl .\n",
      "His renal function continued to worsen and he developed hypervolemic hyponatremia , and hemodynamic parameters consistent with sepsis .\n",
      "Blood cultures in this setting grew out Staphylococcus aureus and antibiotic coverage was altered to cover this organism appropriately .\n",
      "During the first week of February in spite of antibiosis , the patient developed worsening renal failure , became anuric , and developed rapid progression in spite of his chest tube of the right-sided hydrothorax in addition to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates consistent with adult respiratory distress syndrome vs. extreme volume overload .\n",
      "He became dependent on pressers .\n",
      "On the 26th of February , the patient had an extremely large volume gastrointestinal bleed , and worsened hepatic encephalopathy .\n",
      "In consultation with the patient 's primary doctor , Dr. Leynslentnerswaimjesc and with his gastrointestinal physician , Dr. Loydbreunlinke , and with the patient 's family , the decision was made in the setting of his grim prognosis and multiple morbidities that further aggressive treatment would not be pursued .\n",
      "The patient was evaluated for continuous venous venous hemodialysis , which in the end in the setting of the family 's wishes , was not begun with this patient .\n",
      "On the 27th of February , the patient succumbed to overwhelming sepsis and anuric renal failure , and hypervolemia .\n",
      "The time of death was 5:16 A.M. on the 27th of February , 1997 .\n",
      "The family was present .\n",

      "The patient was apparently alone at home , his neighbors heard a single shot , and the paramedics were called .\n",
      "Upon arrival , they found the patient in bed , with notes nearby , listing his funeral home preferences and information on his next of kin .\n",
      "The patient indicates that his neighbors were making excessive noise upstairs from his dwelling , and he found it unbearable .\n",
      "He therefore decided to take his life with a gun which he had found in the house .\n",
      "Apparently , the gun belonged to his father .\n",
      "On further questioning , the patient described that his father passed away approximately forty to fifty years prior to his admission , and the gun was found in a box in their home .\n",

      "He was able to ambulate although somewhat slowly because of his rapid atrial fibrillation .\n",
      "It was considered to obtain a pulmonary consultation on a formal basis , but it was then felt that he would do better by healing fully from his surgery , because he really had little in the way of pulmonary complications , despite the history of sleep apnea of an obstructive basis .\n",
      "Primary in his long term management is cardiac rehabilitation with weight reduction .\n",
      "He will be followed closely in 23 Hwy , Hamp by Dr. Laymie Aslinke .\n",

      "Please see operative note for more details .\n",
      "The patient 's postoperative course was complicated by multiple episodes of aspiration and respiratory failure requiring intubation and ICU transfer .\n",
      "The patient was noted to have a distal esophageal stricture near the site the of the prior paraesophageal hernia repair with a large esophageal dilation above that area .\n",
      "This was thought to be the source of his multiple episodes of aspiration .\n",
      "The patient underwent extensive treatment in both the ICU and the floor , which eventually resulted in extubation and placement of a PEG tube in order to pexy the stomach within the abdominal cavity .\n",
      "This was achieved with good success , and the patient remained extubated on the floor for several days postoperatively .\n",
      "However , on the morning of 9/5/04 the patient did suffer what appeared to be another aspiration event , became hypoxic and a code was called .\n",

      "The patient was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent multiple rounds of the ACLS protocol without resolution of his hypotension , bradycardia or hypoxia .\n",
      "After his aspiration event it was noted that the patient did develop ST elevation in the inferolateral leads .\n",
      "Cardiology was consulted ; however , it was felt that this event was secondary to an aspiration event and therefore not a primary cardiac event .\n",
      "Decision was made not to take him to the Cath Lab , but to medically manage him only .\n",
      "Multiple attempts were made to resuscitate the patient using the ACLS protocol , which were unsuccessful in the setting of his coronary ischemia .\n",
      "After extensive attempts at resuscitation it was noted that we were dealing with a reversible ischemia , and at that time the team did discuss further management with his family .\n",
      "The patient 's daughter did understand the current situation and understood that additional resuscitation attempts would be considered futile .\n",
      "Despite administration of additional medications the patient remained hypotensive and bradycardic , and eventually became asystolic at 8:20 a.m. on 9/5/04 .\n",

      "Reflexes 4+ overall in the upper extremities and 3+ overall in the lower extremities , an upgoing left toe and a down going right toe .\n",
      "His tone was increased on the left side and he had diminished pin prick and light touch in his left upper extremity and slightly in his left lower extremity with a similar finding for vibratory sense , but in an unreliable pattern .\n",
      "He occasionally had extinction in his left upper , greater than lower extremity , but this was fluctuating .\n",
      "Mental state :\n",
      "He was awake , occasionally sleepy but easily aroused , oriented to self , Oaksgekesser/ Memorial Hospital and the date .\n",
      "He was mildly perseverative and inattentive .\n",
      "Coordination :\n",
      "his fine finger movements and rapid alternating movements were within normal limits .\n",
      "He was unable to stand without extensive assistance .\n",

      "Sodium 141 , potassium 3.6 , BUN 14 , creatinine 1.1 , hematocrit 37% , platelets 177 , white blood count 4.1 .\n",
      "Chest x-ray showed degenerative joint disease , an ill defined left hemi-diaphragm without air space disease .\n",
      "On the lateral view , surgical clips in the abdomen .\n",
      "EKG showed normal sinus rhythm , no ST or T wave changes .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE AND TREATMENT :\n",
      "Mr. Finger was admitted for what appeared to be a stroke syndrome involving his left middle cerebral artery territory .\n",
      "He underwent neurovascular doppler studies which showed no significant change in either common carotid or in the left common internal ophthalmic system .\n",
      "However , there were hemodynamic changes which raised the question of right siphon disease .\n",
      "He had normal cervical vertebral arteries .\n",
      "Transcranial dopplers showed no abnormalities in the ophthalmic siphon systems , distal vertebrals , or proximal basilar artery .\n",
      "The proximal , middle , anterior and posterior cerebral arteries , however , could not be insinuated .\n",
      "Over the course of the first hospital day , the patient 's exam deteriorated in a manner that appeared to be blood pressure dependent .\n",
      "He had been started on Heparin from the time of his admission .\n",
      "A computerized tomography scan had showed multiple lacunes , right greater than left , and the deep gray and white matters suspicious for proximal middle cerebral artery stem occlusion or stenosis .\n",
      "MRI / MRA was performed with diffusion weighted images , showing subcortical white matter and basal ganglia infarcts , but preserved middle cerebral artery territory cortex .\n",
      "Because of his blood pressure , dependence of his left sided extremities , the lower leg specifically , he was transferred to the Intensive Care Unit where he underwent hypertensive therapy for several days .\n",
      "His systolic blood pressure goal was initially 170-190 , which he was able to achieve spontaneously for the most part .\n",
      "However , due to the absence of clear benefit at this level , and further deterioration in his left sided strength , this goal was increased and Neo-Synephrine was added to his regimen to achieve mean arterial pressures in the 110-120 range .\n",
      "This strategy and its incumbent risks , particularly in a patient on Heparin , were discussed at length with both the patient and his family , who were very clear in wanting to proceed with all possible efforts to save the use of his left leg .\n",
      "While in the Intensive Care Unit , his strength deteriorated from being able to hold his left leg off the bed up to several inches to loosing virtually all distal extremity strength , and having a 2-3/5 power in his proximal left leg groups .\n",
      "He also , as Neo-Synephrinewas tapered , developed mild sensory findings , in particular diminished large fiber sensibility in his left hand , although he at times , including near the end of his Intensive Care Unit stay had a right gaze preference .\n",
      "In terms of exploring his visual space , he was able to look to the left , and it was not possible to elicit clear evidence for a field deficit .\n",
      "He was followed by speech and swallowing service , who assisted in the management of po intake which gradually improved , although he clearly had problems with manipulation of food in the left side of his mouth and would tend to accumulate a pouch of food in his left cheek .\n",
      "I should mention that his blood pressure therapy was at times limited by a severe headache , although he also had this off the pressor .\n",
      "He had several repeat imaging studies during his Intensive Care Unit stay which showed further demarcation , but not extension of his prior infarct , both on computerized tomography scan and DWI images .\n",
      "Additionally , he had a perfusion , diffusion MR study earlier on , which suggested the presence of viable penumbra , including the overlying cortex .\n",
      "He was transferred to the regular neurology floor once it became clear that he was not receiving any significant benefit from hypertensive therapy .\n",
      "At this time , his neurologic exam is notable for hemiplegia of his left arm , severe hemiparesis of his left leg , mild large fiber sensory loss in his left arm , and otherwise fairly intact mental status , cranial nerve function , and right sided motor and sensory function .\n",
      "We anticipate that he represents a good rehab potential .\n",
      "He will be discharged to rehab on a regimen of Coumadin 5 mg po today then daily for an INR goal of 2-3 , Ofloxacin 400 mg po bid to be discontinued on 11/05/96 , Dexedrine 5 mg po qd , Omeprazole 20mg po qd , Erythromycin eye ointment OU bid , Heparin at its present rate adjusting per partial thromboplastin time bid , and discontinuing when the Coumadin is therapeutic , Tylenol 650 mg po q4 prn , Colace 100 mg po bid .\n",
      "Follow up will be with Dr. Tvi Fine of Neurology , and Dr. Doll Grendbly of internal medicine and primary care , shortly after discharge from rehab .\n",

      "HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS :\n",
      "Nakoloyd Knutzxelljesc is a fifty-one year old female who presented with metastatic lung cancer in July 1994 .\n",
      "A work up at that time included a chest X-ray which showed a right hilar mass .\n",
      "A chest computerized tomography scan showed a right hilar mass , extensive mediastinal adenopathy .\n",
      "A bone scan showed lesions at T12 and T9 .\n",
      "Abdominal CT scan showed normal adrenal .\n",
      "Magnetic resonance imaging study of the spine revealed an erosive lesion at T12 and no cord compression .\n",
      "A biopsy revealed adenocarcinoma .\n",
      "The patient was entered onto the ICE-T protocol and received three cycles of ICE-T.\n",
      "After cycle two she had an MRI of the T-spine which showed some improvement in the disease .\n",
      "After cycle three , she developed severe headache .\n",
      "An MRI of the central nervous system was done and was unremarkable .\n",
      "The pain her head became so severe she was admitted to E Health after cycle three with fever , neutropenia , headache , and a cellulitis on the left forearm possibly from an intravenous site .\n",
      "She was discharged from the hospital on 11-04-94 with all of her problems under reasonable control except for her severe headache .\n",
      "She called me on November 5 , which was one day later , with the headache becoming much worse and becoming disabling .\n",
      "She , therefore , was admitted for evaluation .\n",
      "PHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\n",
      "The physical examination revealed a middle aged woman with alopecia , and in no acute distress .\n",
      "The blood pressure was 100/60 , pulse of 70 , respirations of 20 , temperature was 98.6 .\n",
      "Skin with alopecia , as noted .\n",
      "HEENT examination was unremarkable .\n",
      "The neck was supple .\n",
      "The lungs were clear .\n",
      "Heart revealed regular rate and rhythm , without murmurs .\n",
      "Breast exam with status post bilateral implants .\n",
      "Belly was soft and nontender .\n",
      "Extremities without edema .\n",
      "The neurological examination was nonfocal .\n",
      "LABORATORY DATA :\n",
      "The white blood count was 9.8 , hematocrit was 29.1 , platelet count was 233,000 .\n",
      "She had 58% polys , 21% bands , 7% lymphs , 7% monos .\n",
      "The prothrombin time was 10.6 .\n",
      "The BUN and creatinine was 13/0.7 , glucose 115 , amylase less than 30 , calcium 9.2 , phosphorus 4.9 , magnesium 1.7 , alkaline phosphatase 302 , SGOT 42 , LDH 360 , CPK 348 .\n",
      "HOSPITAL COURSE :\n",
      "Because of the severe headache , she was seen in consultation by Dr. Rashanemar Block and Dr. Riord R. Hall .\n",
      "Dr. Rashanemar Block did a lumbar puncture which revealed an opening pressure of 27 , and her cytologies came back positive for adenocarcinoma .\n",
      "She was seen in consultation by the Pain Service who placed her on a posterior communicating artery pump which helped her dramatically .\n",
      "In addition , we obtained both cranial and neck MR which showed no evidence of any enhancement or epidural abscess .\n",
      "When it was found that she had carcinomatous meningitis , she began interthecal methotrexate , given to her every three to four days by Dr. Hall .\n",
      "This was well tolerated .\n",
      "Her cerebrospinal fluid pressure remained greater than 35 cm of water for the first several days and because of this we decided to place an Ommaya reservoir .\n",
      "The patient was seen in consultation by Radiation Therapy who did not feel that radiation at this point would offer any advantages .\n",
      "She had a CSF flow study which showed normal flow CSF throughout her brain .\n",
      "She had multiple episodes of seizures during the hospitalization and required therapy with Tegretol .\n",
      "She was given some Mexiletine and Trazodone and did not tolerate that well .\n",
      "Once she was on good anti-seizure medicine , she calmed down very nicely in terms of not having any additional seizures .\n",
      "For the last several days of her hospitalization , we switched her over to a Duragesic patch and she actually took 300 micrograms per hour of Duragesic and that seemed to make a big difference in terms of her pain control .\n",
      "Her headache came under very nice control with aggressive Duragesic patch .\n",
      "Access became a major problem and we had Dr. Anruchelle Chaffchird from Surgical Oncology place a double Port-a-cath without difficulty .\n",
      "The plan with Knutzxelljesc will be to follow her very carefully .\n",
      "She will be coming back to see us next Tuesday for infusion of her methotrexate .\n",

a 60 year-old man presented with a two year history with right neck pain .\\nAn initial CT scan was negative , however , eventually a scan in August , 1996 showed a right wedge skull base mass .\\nIn September , 1997 he underwent cerebral angiography complicated by an embolic cerebrovascular accident which presented with confusion in an right homonymous hemianopsia .\\nHe was taken to the Intensive Care Unit .\\nA follow-up MRI showed low attenuation lesions in both occipital lobes consistent with embolic stroke .\\nHe was treated with aspirin .\\nNovember 19 , 1997 , he underwent a resection of a skull base chordoma and a lateral mandibulotomy with tracheostomy .\\nPostoperatively he had a right true vocal cord paralysis with evidence of aspiration and he therefore received Gelfoam insertion injection into the vocal cord and a PEG was preformed .\\nHe was discharged home with at follow-up MRI and on December 25 , 1997 again revealed a large ill defined lobulated skull based mass with a mass effect on the medulla .\\nNow preoperatively he reports occasional sharp pains in his right jaw that last about five seconds then resolves as well as loss of his right peripheral vision , difficulty swallowing .\\nHe is taking some liquids p.o. but also has G-tube feedings q.2h.\\nPAST MEDICAL HISTORY :\\nStatus post tonsillectomy , status post appendectomy , status post lumbar fusion remote .\\nDIET :\\nJevity Plus one can q.12h. by G-tube , some liquids .\\nALLERGIES :\\nThe patient is allergic to Codeine which causes nausea and Morphine which causes swelling .\\nMEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION :\\nAspirin discontinued in two weeks prior to admission .\\nSOCIAL HISTORY :\\nDenies use of alcohol and tobacco .\\nHe is married and lives in Nebraska , works as a car dealer , has four grandchildren .\\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION :\\nVital signs :\\nHeart rate 64 , blood pressure 120/80 .\\nGeneral :\\nThis is a pleasant 60 year-old man whose distressed .\\nHEENT , normocephalic , atraumatic , well healed right jaw incision , slight swelling right jaw slightly tender to the touch , there is no erythema .\\nLungs are clear to auscultation .\\nHeart regular rate

difficulty of tongue movement .\\nCranial nerves , right visual field deficit , decreased gag , tongue is atrophic and deviates to the right .\\nStrength five out of five bilateral upper and lower extremities .\\nDeep tendon reflexes 2+ symmetric , toes downgoing .\\nCerebella intact .\\nGait steady .\\nHOSPITAL COURSE :\\nThis 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .\\nPostoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\\nHe was extubated on postoperative day number one .\\nHis neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\\nHe was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\\nHe was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\\nHe noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nOn postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\\nHe vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\\nA head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\\nA lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\\nA culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\\nHe was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\\nHe was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\\nA video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\\nBecause of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\\nHe underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\\nPrior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\\nAfter conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\\nIt was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\\nHis visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\\nHis lumbar drain was removed after five days .\\nHe was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\\nHe is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .\\n2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.\\nHe will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .\\nFOLLOW-UP :\\nFollow-up will be with Dr. Sick in one weeks time .\\nHe will needed a follow-up CT or MRI for the pseudomeningocele .\\nADDENDUM\\nMr. Marker will be restarted on his preoperative Aspirin as he is now far enough out from his surgery .\\nMEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\\n1) Aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d.\\n2) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. times seven days .\\nDictated By :\\nSTISIE H.

      "This 60 year-old man with a right suboccipital chordoma status post prior resection was admitted and then underwent on Jan 22 , 1997 a right suboccipital craniotomy with microresection of tumor along with a laminectomy .\n",
      "Postoperatively , he was taken to the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit where he remained intubated .\n",
      "He was extubated on postoperative day number one .\n",
      "His neurological examination remained unchanged with continued right tongue deviation and lack of gag reflex .\n",
      "He was transferred to the floor on postoperative day number two and he was ambulating .\n",
      "He was seen by Physical Therapy who noted that he had problems with balancing and he used a rolling walker .\n",
      "He noticed some nose dripping on postoperative day number four however in the next several days there was no evidence of this cerebrospinal fluid leak as he denied any further nose dripping however he was placed on antibiotics to cover a possible cerebrospinal fluid leak .\n",
      "On postoperative day number eight he again reported leaking from the right nostril .\n",
      "He vomited once and had intermittent headaches .\n",
      "A head CT was done to evaluate a possible hydrocephalus , no hydrocephalus was seen where there was an old infarct in the right frontal lobe white matter and the occipital region with a pseudomeningocele , status post resection of the right skull based tumor extending to the C2 level .\n",
      "A lumbar drain was placed and for the next five days 50 cc was drained every eight hours .\n",
      "A culture taken from the lumbar drain showed Staphylococcus aureus resistant to the Nafcillin which he was receiving and he was therefore placed on Vancomycin .\n",
      "He was also receiving Ofloxacin for a presumed aspiration pneumonia and a Staphylococcus aureus from his cerebrospinal fluid was sensitive to both Vancomycin and Ofloxacin .\n",
      "He was followed by the Speech Pathology Team who noted that he still had evidence of aspiration .\n",
      "A video swallow was done which showed moderately severe oral pharyngeal dysphasia with premature spill over and laryngeal penetration with aspiration of some liquids .\n",
      "Because of continuing complaints by Mr. Marker about nausea with his tube feedings and concern with his aspiration the G-tube feedings were not ideal .\n",
      "He underwent a conversion of his gastrostomy tube to an transgastrojejunostomy tube by the Interventional Radiologist on Feb 04 , 1997 .\n",
      "Prior to admission Mr. Marker had been taking one can of Jevity every two hours as a bolus .\n",
      "After conversion to a jejunostomy tube one would normally use continuous feedings , however Mr. Marker did not want to use continuous feedings , he prefers the boluses which would not require him to be attached to a feeding tube .\n",
      "It was explained to him that this can result in diarrhea but he has elected to continue bolus feedings .\n",
      "His visiting nurse will be instructed to observe for diarrhea and if problems develop a home jejunostomy feeding tube apparatus will be obtained .\n",
      "His lumbar drain was removed after five days .\n",
      "He was observed overnight and there is no current evidence of cerebrospinal fluid leak .\n",
      "He is therefore being discharged on postoperative day number fifteen .\n",
      "MEDICATIONS ON DISCHARGE :\n",
      "1) Ofloxacin 400 mg p.o. b.i.d. for one week .\n",
      "2) Jevity Plus one can q.2h.\n",
      "He will have visiting nurse and home Physical Therapy services .\n",
      "FOLLOW-UP :\n",
